# Justification of the budget applied for

<!-- Describe briefly the primary costs you intend to cover within the framework for the grant budget. -->

The primary costs that I intend to cover within the framework for this grant budget are:

- my research time, corresponding to 30% of full time for five years;
- the salary of one PhD-student, full-time, for three years;
- the salary of one research assistant, corresponding to 20% of full time for three years;
- the salary of one postdoctoral researcher, full-time, for two years; and
- travel and accommodation during research visits to trial sites and collaborators.

I have applied for the remaining project costs related to project management, data collection, trial monitoring and ATLSÂ® training in my application for the Swedish Research Council Project Grant in Medicine and Health.
