This trial is not yet fully funded. The TMG has decided to proceed with the trial with the expectation that funding will be secured. The TSC will be informed of the funding status at each meeting. If funding is not secured, the trial will be stopped. This will likely result in an underpowered trial. The justification for this decision is that the intervention is considered standard of care in many countries and the data collection is considered minimal risk. There is therefore a very small risk of harm to patient participants, but a potential direct benefit to those patient participants who receive the intervention. The benefit-risk ratio is therefore considered to be favourable, even in the case of an underpowered trial.
