#### Main stepped wedge design and primary outcome

With `r clusters` clusters across `r batches` batches and a total sample size of `r sample.size` our study has ~90% power across different combinations of cluster autocorrelations (CAC) and intra-cluster correlations (ICC) to detect a reduction in the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality within 30 days from 20% under standard care to 15% after ATLS^®^ training (see @fig-power-curves). This effect is a conservative estimate and the reduction equals a risk ratio of 0.75, which would be clinically important while also being consistent with our pilot study and updated systematic review. We allowed for the clustered design and assumed an ICC of 0.02, but considered sensitivity across the range 0.01-0.05 [@Campbell2005; @Eldridge2015], and a CAC of 0.9 but considered sensitivity across the range 0.8-1.0, based on our pilot study and current guidance [@Hemming2020Feb; @Martin2016; @Korevaar2021]. We included the CAC to allow for variation in clustering over time. We assume that each cluster will contribute approximately `r observations.per.month` observations per month to the analysis, based on our previous work.

Under this scenario, we would need to increase the sample size per month to around 30 observations to achieve 90% powere under most combinations of CAC and ICC."

#### Nested staircase design and secondary outcomes

The secondary outcomes that will be measured using the nested staircase design are adherence to ATLS^®^ principles during initial patient resuscitation, quality of life, and disability. The expected effect of the intervention on each of these outcomes are an improvement in adherence from 50% during standard care to 70% after training [@lashoher_implementation_2017], an increase in EQ5D5L health status from 70 during care to 75 after training [@kapitan_effect_2024], and finally a decrease in disability from a baseline value of 25 during standard care to 22.5 after training [@higgins_psychometric_2021]. For quality of life and disability, these effects correspond to standardised effect sizes, expressed as Cohen's d, of 0.5. With 30 clusters in total, six per sequence, for a discrete time decay correlation structure, with ICCs of 0.01 to 0.15 and a CAC of 0.8, there is >80% power to detect an these effects by including four patients in each cluster in each period. Accounting for loss to follow-up, we will include at least six patients per cluster per month. These patients will be a random subset of patients included during the staircase months. The random subset will be selected using simple random sampling on the shift level, meaning that the timing of the clinical research coordinator's shift will be randomised to cover approximately eight hours during the morning, afternoon, or night shift. Adherence to ATLS^®^ principles, quality of life, and disability will be measured in all patients included during these shifts. In each hospital, the number of shifts that will be randomised will be determined by the volume of patients included during the months preceding the staircase months.
