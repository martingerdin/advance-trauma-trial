Trial management and oversight is governed by four trial committees and groups: the Trial Team (TT), the Trial Management Group (TMG), the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). These groups are briefly described below and their relationships are shown in @fig-organisation-overview. Details about each committee and group are available in their respective charter.

## Trial team

**Responsibility**

To run the trial on a day-to-day basis, maintain trial databases, randomise clusters, ensuring complete and correct data, preparing reports for meetings (including those of the TMG, TSC and DMC) and dealing with research governance and, if appropriate, regulatory matters.

**Composition**

Includes the project manager, clinical research associates, principal investigator and co-investigators as needed. 

**Relationships**

Reports to the TMG, TSC and DMC. Operationalises decisions made by the TMG.

**Meeting frequencies**

As often as needed, often weekly or bi-weekly.

## Trial Management Group (TMG)

**Responsibility**

To manage the trial, including its clinical and practical aspects.

**Composition**

Includes members with broad expertise appropriate to the trial. The TMG will be chaired by the Principal Investigator.

## Trial Steering Committee (TSC)

**Responsibility**

The TSC's responsibility is to oversee the trial and offer guidance to the TMG.

**Composition**

A majority of independent members, including a chair, and a minority of members with a direct interest in the trial, including the principal investigator. The chair should be independent of the trial, the sponsor, and the coordinator.

**Meeting frequencies**

Yearly, but may be more frequent if needed.

## Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)

**Responsibility**

To review results of interim analyses, safety events reported by the TMG, and review trial data for each batch, assessing data quality, completeness, cluster performance in recruitment and loss to follow-up rates, and external factors affecting trial validity, safety, or ethics.

**Composition**

Four external experts specializing in clinical trial management, biostatistics, medical ethics, and the pertinent clinical area.

**Relationships**

Reports to the TSC. Receives reports from the TT.

**Meeting frequencies**
