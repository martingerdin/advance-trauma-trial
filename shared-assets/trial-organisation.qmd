Trial management and oversight is governed by three trial committees and groups: the Trial Team (TT), the Trial Management Group (TMG), the joint Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committee (SDMC). These groups and their relationships are briefly described in @fig-organisation-overview. Details about each committee and group are available in their respective charter.
