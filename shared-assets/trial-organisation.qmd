Trial management and oversight is governed by three trial committees and groups: the Trial Team (TT), the Trial Management Group (TMG), the Joint Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committee (TSDMC). These groups are briefly described below and their relationships are shown in @fig-organisation-overview. Details about each committee and group are available in their respective charter.

## Trial team

**Responsibility**

To run the trial on a day-to-day basis, maintain trial databases, randomise clusters, ensuring complete and correct data, preparing reports for meetings (including those of the TMG, TSC and DMC) and dealing with research governance and, if appropriate, regulatory matters.

**Composition**

Includes the project manager, clinical research associates, principal investigator and co-investigators as needed. 

**Relationships**

Reports to the TMG and TSDMC. Operationalises decisions made by the TMG.

**Meeting frequencies**

As often as needed, often weekly or bi-weekly.

## Trial Management Group (TMG)

## Joint Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committee (TSDMC)

**Responsibility**

The TSDMC's responsibility is to oversee the trial, review results of interim analyses and safety events reported by the TMG, and review trial data for each batch, assessing data quality, completeness, cluster performance in recruitment and loss to follow-up rates, and external factors affecting trial validity, safety, or ethics. This committee also offer guidance to the TMG.

**Composition**

A majority of independent members, including a chair and three additional external experts specializing in the clinical area, biostatistics, medical ethics, and a community or patient representative, as well as and a minority of members with a direct interest in the trial, including the principal investigator. The chair should be independent of the trial, and the coordinating institutions Karolinska Institutet and The George Institute for Global Health.
