**Title**
Effects of Advanced Trauma Life Support^®^ Training Compared to Standard Care on Adult Trauma Patient Outcomes: A Cluster Randomised Trial

<!-- **Acronym** -->

**Rationale**
Trauma is a massive global health issue. Many training programmes have been developed to help physicians in the initial management of trauma patients. Among these programmes, Advanced Trauma Life Support^®^ (ATLS^®^) is the most popular, having trained over one million physicians worldwide. Despite its widespread use, there are no controlled trials showing that ATLS^®^ improves patient outcomes. Multiple systematic reviews emphasise the need for such trials.

**Aim**
To compare the effects of ATLS^®^ training with standard care on outcomes in adult trauma patients.

**Primary Outcome**
All-cause mortality within 30 days of arrival at the emergency department.

**Trial Design**
Batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial in India.

**Trial Population**
Adult trauma patients presenting to the emergency department of a participating hospital.

**Sample Size** 
`r number_to_text(clusters)` clusters and `r number_to_text(sample.size)` patients.

**Eligibility Criteria**

*Hospitals* are secondary or tertiary hospitals in India that admit or refer/transfer for admission at least 400 patients with trauma per year. 

*Clusters* are one or more units of physicians providing initial trauma care in the emergency department of tertiary hospitals in India.

*Patients participants* are adult trauma patients who presents to the emergency department of participating hospitals and are admitted or transferred for admission.

**Intervention** 
The intervention will be ATLS^®^ training, a proprietary 2.5 day course teaching a standardised approach to trauma patient care using the concepts of a primary and secondary survey. Physicians will be trained in an accredited ATLS^®^ training facility in India. 

**Ethical Considerations** 
We will use an opt-out consent approach for in-hospital data collection, in which consent is presumed unless actively declined. We will obtain informed consent for out of hospital follow up. Patients who are unconscious or lack a legally authorized representative will be included under a waiver of informed consent. Note that consent here refers to consent to data collection, as it will not be possible for patients to opt out from being subjected to the intervention. This approach is justified because the trial can be considered to involve only minimal risk and the data collection is non-invasive and mostly involve extracting routinely collected data from medical records.

**Trial Period**
October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2029
