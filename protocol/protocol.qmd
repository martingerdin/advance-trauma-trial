# Synopsis

{{< include ../shared-assets/synopsis.qmd >}}

\newpage

# Background and rationale

Each year, 4.3 million people die from trauma [@injuries2020]. Among people aged 10-24 and 25-49 years trauma is the largest cause of disability adjusted life years [@GBD2020]. Most deaths from trauma occur within the first 24-48 hours  [@Rauf2019]. Traumatic brain injury and exsanguination are the most common causes of trauma deaths [@Roy2017; @Callcut2019]. Most preventable trauma deaths are caused by clinical judgement errors during initial resuscitation or early care including airway management and haemorrhage control, even though the deaths occur later during the hospital stay [@Roy2017; @Ghorbani2018].

Several trauma life support training programmes have been developed to improve the early management of patients in the hospital by providing a structured framework for assessment and treatment [@Mohammad2013; @Jayaraman2014; @Kadhum2020; @Jin2021]. The proprietary Advanced Trauma Life Support^®^ (ATLS^®^) is the most established trauma life support training programme and more than one million physicians in over 80 countries have been trained in the programme since the first course in 1978 [@acsAtls2018]. In the US and many other countries training in ATLS^®^ is virtually mandatory for trauma care physicians [@ACS2022]. Uptake in low- and middle income countries (LMIC) has been slow, potentially due to high costs [@Kadhum2020].

There are three randomised controlled studies showing that ATLS^®^ improves knowledge and clinical skills [@Ali1995; @Ali1996; @Ali1999], but there are no randomised controlled trials or high-quality quasi-experimental trials indicating that ATLS^®^ improves patient outcomes [@Mohammad2013; @Jayaraman2014; @Jin2021]. We conducted an updated systematic review for project (unpublished), and estimated a pooled risk ratio of `r pooled.rr` (95% CI `r pooled.ci`) from  `r number_to_text(number.identified.studies)` heterogeneous (I^2^ `r I2`) retrospective or small studies on the effect of ATLS on mortality (see @fig-forest-plot) `r pooled.studies.citation`. No study assessed functional outcomes.

We conducted a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05417243) that we conducted between `r pilot.start.date` and `r pilot.end.date` as part of our network grant to assess the feasibility of a full scale trial. We published the protocol for this pilot study [@GerdinWärnberg2022]. Our pilot study enrolled  `r tern.patients` patients from seven hospitals across India (unpublished data) and shows that it is feasible to conduct the proposed trial with a high percentage of patients consenting to out of hospital follow up (`r to_percent(recruitment.rate)`%), low loss to follow-up rate (`r to_percent(rate.lost.to.follow.up)`%), and low missingness in key variables (mean `r mean.missing.data`%).

To involve patients and the public in the planning of this trial we conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with trauma patients, caregivers, and community representatives (unpublished data). The aim of these interviews was to understand their views on the trial and important outcomes and the interviews showed high acceptability of our research and emphasised the importance of better recovery before discharge and functional outcomes at and after discharge, including pain, mobility and self-care activities. The interviews also highlighted return to work as an important outcome.

## Updated systematic review
We performed a systematic literature search in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases (PROSPERO ID CRD42022373977). The last search was conducted on November 11, 2022. We developed the search strategy in Medline (Ovid) in collaboration with librarians at the Karolinska Institutet University Library. We limited the search to English language articles, searched all databases from inception, and screened a total of 7896 records. We used a random effects model to pool estimates across studies.

```

# Benefit-risk evaluation 

The direct risks includes integrity violations and data leakage. We will mitigate these risks by employing rigorous data collection and storage mechanisms. The procedures that we will use to collect data will be direct observation of care, routine physical examinations, questionnaires, and extraction of already collected data from patient records, which are often seen as involving only minimal risk. 

The long-term risks of the research and the risk that the research will be used in detrimental ways are minimal. Our trial will assess the effect of Advanced Trauma Life Support^®^ (ATLS^®^) on patient outcomes. Training in ATLS^®^ is standard in many health care systems and it is unlikely that training physicians in this programme induces any harm to participants. 

We consider these risks weighed up by the potential direct benefit for the participants in the intervention phase, if ATLS^®^ is found to improve patient outcomes, and by the potential for improved care for the trauma patient population.

# Trial aim

To compare the effects of ATLS^®^ training with standard care on outcomes in adult trauma patients.

# Regulatory approvals and trial registration

We will submit this trial to the Health Ministry Screening Committee at the Indian Council for Medical Research for their approval. We will apply for ethical approvals from each participating hospital, The George Institute for Global Health in India and the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. We will register this trial with Clinical Trials Registry-India and ClinicalTrials.gov.

# Trial design and procedures

## Overall trial design 

We will conduct a batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial (see @fig-trial-design). The stepped-wedge trial is a uni-directional cross-over trial but the time point when clusters cross-over from standard care to the intervention is randomised [@Hemming2015]. Each cluster will be at least one unit of physicians performing initial resuscitation of trauma patients in the emergency department of tertiary hospitals in India. The number of units that we will train in each hospital will depend on the sizes of these units and the volumes of patients that they see. If more than one unit is trained in the same hospital these units will be considered one unit for the purpose of randomization. We choose this approach for two reasons: 1) it will not be logistically or financially feasible to train all physician in a given hospital; and 2) we need to balance cluster size with the number of clusters. We will conduct this trial in India because physicians providing initial trauma care in India are so far not routinely trained in ATLS^®^ or similar programmes.

We will roll out the interventions to `r clusters` clusters over `r number_to_text(batches)` batches, so there will be `r number_to_text(clusters/batches)` clusters in each batch. The clusters in each batch will be randomised to one of `r number_to_text(sequences)` implementation sequences, with `r number_to_text(clusters.per.sequence)` hospital randomised to each implementation sequence. All clusters will transition through three phases, first a standard care phase, then a `r number_to_text(transition.months)` month transition phase during which the training is delivered, and finally an intervention phase, for a total of `r number_to_text(total.months)` months. The implementation sequence determines how long the phases of standard care and intervention are. Patient participants will be followed up for a total of `r number_to_text(follow.up.months)` months. 

## Design justification

We use the cluster randomised design because the intervention cannot be randomised at the individual patient level. We use the stepped-wedge design for two reasons. First, this design is statistically more efficient than the parallel cluster design when the number of clusters is limited [@Hemming2020May]. In this trial, the number of clusters is limited because of the costs associated with ATLS^®^ training and the available slots for ATLS^®^ training in India. Second, the stepped-wedge design is likely to enhance participation and engagement because all clusters receive the intervention. The batched stepped-wedge design further improves feasibility as it does not require all clusters to start at the same time, and it is robust to potential delays in cluster recruitment [@Kasza2022].

## Eligibility criteria

Our trial include eligibility criteria on three levels: hospitals, clusters and patient participants. We include eligibility on both the hospital and cluster level to facilitate the screening process.

## Hospital selection

Hospitals will be secondary or tertiary hospitals providing trauma care in India.

### Inclusions criteria

**Hospitals** must meet the following criteria:

- admit or refer/transfer for admission at least 400 patients with trauma per year or 35 patients with trauma per month for at least the last six months;
- provide surgical and orthopaedic emergency services around the clock; and
- have at most 25% of physicians providing initial trauma care trained in a formalised trauma life support training programme, like ATLS^®^ or Primary Trauma Care (PTC).

### Exclusion criteria

**Hospitals** are excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

- the hospital of the cluster implements a formalised trauma life support training programme [^note:concurrent-training-programmes] during the trial period; or
- the hospital of the cluster plan to implement or implements other major interventions[^note:major-interventions] that affects trauma care during the trial period.

[^note:concurrent-training-programmes]: These include but are not limited to the National Emergency Life Support (NELS) programme, the Basic Trauma Life Support (BTLS) programme, the Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) programme, the Trauma Nursing Core Course (TNCC) and the Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses (ATCN) programme.

[^note:major-interventions]: These include but are not limited to implementing of a trauma team approach, opening a trauma centre and  implementing a trauma quality improvement programme.

### Screening

The trial management group will compile a list of hospitals with potentially eligible clusters and reach out to them to assess their interest in participating in the trial. We will then screen hospitals for eligibility based on the criteria above, using a two-step procedure. First, we will approach hospitals to complete an initial hospital screening instrument (see Appendix @sec-appendix-hospital-screening-instrument). We will then discuss each eligible hospital individually in the Trial Management Group before deciding whether to include it in the trial. We have this discussion because we strive to include hospitals that to a large extent conducts primary resuscitation of trauma patients, rather than hospitals that primarily receives transferred patients from other hospitals, but this is difficult to formalise in the eligibility criteria. We will then perform a more in-depth interview with selected hospitals (See Appendix @sec-appendix-hospital-screening-interview-instrument). To avoid excluding centres we will also discuss plans to implement other potentially competing interventions during the trial period, and take these plans into account when assigning clusters to batches. For example, we are aware of the ongoing implementation of the National Emergency Life Support (NELS) programme in India, and will therefore not include hospitals that plan to implement this programme during the trial period. All screening steps and decisions will be logged using REDCap [@harris_research_2009; @harris_redcap_2019]. 

## Cluster selection

Clusters are one or more units of physicians providing initial trauma care in the emergency department of secondary or tertiary hospitals in India.

### Inclusion criteria

**Clusters** must meet the following criteria:

- admits or refers/transfers for admission at least 12 patients with trauma per month for at least the last six months, meaning that the hospital of the cluster should admit or refer for admission 400 patients with trauma per year or 35 patients with trauma per month for at least the last six months;
- the hospital of the cluster provides surgical and orthopaedic emergency services around the clock; and
- no more than 25% of physicians providing initial trauma care trained in a formalised trauma life support training programme.

### Screening

The screening of clusters is part of the hospital screening process. 

## Patient participants selection

Patient participants are adult trauma patients who presents to the emergency department of participating hospitals and are admitted or transferred for admission.

### Inclusion criteria

**Patients participants** must meet the following criteria:

- age of at least 15 years;
- present to the emergency department of participating hospitals, with a history of trauma defined as having any of the reasons listed in the International Classification of Diseases chapter XX as the reason for presenting;
- admitted or died between arrival at the hospital and admission, or referred/transferred from the emergency department of a participating hospital to another hospital for admission; and
- trauma occurred less than 48 hours before arrival at the hospital.

### Exclusion criteria

**Patients participants** are excluded if they meet the following criteria:

- present with isolated limb injuries; or
- are directly admitted to a ward without being seen by a physician in the emergency department.

### Screening

Clinical research coordinators will screen patient participants either as they arrive to the emergency department or using emergency department registers. Once the patient is admitted, the clinical research coordinators will approach eligible patients or their representatives to provide study information and inform participants that they can opt out from the study at any time before final analysis. Patients who are transferred before they have had an opportunity to be informed about the study will be contacted by phone. Phone numbers will be extracted from the emergency department registers, and will be securely held only by the clinical research coordinators at each sites

### Withdrawal criteria

Patient participants can choose to withdraw their consent at any time before the final analysis. If they withdraw their consent the clinical research coordinator will not contact them for additional follow ups. They can also choose to have the data collected about them removed from the trial at any time before final analysis of the data. Withdrawal of consent or removal of data from the trial will not affect their care in any way. If the patient participant withdraws consent, follow-up of this participant will be performed according to the participating hospitals routine.

## Procedures

@tbl-procedures shows an overview of trial procedures. Clinical research coordinators will follow up patients daily until discharge to capture injury information. They will also follow up patients at 24 hours, 30 days and 90 days after arrival to the emergency department to capture mortality outcomes, and at 30 days and 90 days after arrival to the emergency department to capture functional outcomes and return to work. If patient participants are discharged before any of these follow-up time points, clinical research coordinators will follow up patients by phone.

## Biological sampling procedures

This trial does not include biological sampling.

## End of Trial

The trial ends when the last patient participant has completed the last follow-up. The trial may be prematurely terminated if it this is necessary for safety reasons affecting the risk-benefit balance or if the recruitment of subjects cannot be met within reasonable time limits. If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the investigator should immediately inform the subjects about this and ensure appropriate treatment and follow-up. Decisions on premature termination are taken by the Trial Steering Committee and Trial Management Group.

## Intervention and control treatment

The intervention will be ATLS^®^ training. The control will be standard care, meaning no formal trauma life support training. We will train the physicians that initially resuscitate and provide trauma care during the first hour after patient arrival at the emergency department. These physicians can be casualty medical officers, surgical residents, or emergency medicine residents, depending on the setup at each participating centre. The training will occur during the transition phase in each cluster. Our experience from our pilot study is that study sites adhere to the training slot alloted to them through the trial, so we judge the risk of clusters implementing ATLS^®^ before their randomised implementation sequence as very low. 

We will train the number units of physicians needed to reach the required patient sample size, but estimate that this will require training an average of ten physicians per hospital, which on average should be mean that we can train one to two units per hospital. This is possible because many hospitals in India organise physicians staffing their emergency departments in units, and the physicians in the same unit work together in the emergency department on the same days of the week. We will therefore collect data only on the days when these units work. The units selected to constitute a cluster from each hospital will be a convenience sample out of all eligible units in those hospitals.

**Advanced Trauma Life Support^®^ (ATLS^®^) [@acsAtls2018]** is a proprietary 2.5 day course teaching a standardised approach to trauma patient care using the concepts of a primary and secondary survey. The programme was developed by the Committee of Trauma of the American College of Surgeons. The course includes intial treatment and resuscitation, triage and interfacility transfers. Leaning is based on practical scenario-driven skill stations, lectures and includes a final performance proficiency evaluation. Physicians will be trained in an accredited ATLS^®^ training facility in India. 

**Standard care** varies across hospitals in India, but trauma patients are initially managed by casualty medical officers, surgical residents, or emergency medicine residents. They are mainly first- or second-year residents who resuscitate patients, perform interventions and refer patients for imaging or other investigations. Compared with other settings where a trauma team approach is adopted, nurses and other healthcare professionals are only involved to a limited extent during the initial management. 

### Description of investigational medicinal products

This trial does not include any investigational medicinal products.

### Auxiliary medicinal products

This trial does not include any auxiliary medicinal products.

### Concomitant use of other medications or treatments

Other than implementing another formalised trauma life support training programme or other major interventions to change the care of trauma patients as specified in the exclusion criteria, concomitant use of other medications and treatments may be provided at the discretion of the investigators and will not be considered an exclusion criterion.

## Randomization

We will assign clusters to batches as they are found to be eligible and receive ethical approval. Batches will include clusters from hospitals in different regions to optimize trial logistics. We will randomize the clusters alloted to each batch to the different intervention implementation sequences within that batch[^randomization]. We will balance the randomization within each batch on cluster size, defined as monthly volume of eligible patient participants, using covariate constrained randomization. We will conceal the randomization order for as long as it is logistically possible, considering that arrangements for sending physicians to ATLS^®^ training need to be made in advance.

[^randomization]: Randomization will be done using bespoke code from previous trials.

## Blinding

It is not possible to blind a stepped-wedge trial, because all clusters receive the intervention. 

## Treatment after trial end

When the trial ends, the intervention will have been implemented in all clusters.

## Outcomes

### Primary outcome

The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality within 30 days of arrival at the emergency department. Clinical research coordinators will extract information on death from patient hospital records, by calling the patient or a patient representative, or if the patient has been transferred to another hospital by contacting the hospital to which the patient was transferred. Data on this outcome will be collected continuously during the trial. We chose this outcome as the primary outcome because it is an outcome of clinical and patient importance with very low missing data rates (`r rates.missing.data["in.hospital.mortality"]`%) in our pilot study. We will also be able to compare our findings with previous research.

### Secondary outcomes

- All cause mortality within 24 hours and three months of arrival at the emergency department. Data on this outcome will be collected in the same way as for the primary outcome.
- In-hospital mortality within 30 days of arrival at the emergency department. Data on this outcome will be collected in the same way as for the primary outcome. 
- Quality of life within seven days of discharge, and at 30 days and three months of arrival at the emergency department, measured by the official and validated translations of the EQ5D3L. Data on this outcome will be collected in person if the patient is still in hospital, or by phone if the patient has been discharged. We will collect this data from a stratified random sample (site and period) of patient participants. The sampling will be  designed so that is maximises statistical efficiency.
- Disability within seven days of discharge, and at 30 days and three months of arrival at the emergency department, assessed using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). Data on this outcome will be collected in person if the patient is still in hospital, or by phone if the patient has been discharged. This data will also be collected from a stratified random sample of participants.
- Return to work at 30 days and three months after arrival at the emergency department. Data on this outcome will be collected in person if the patient is still in hospital, or by phone if the patient has been discharged.
- Length of emergency department stay. Data on this outcome will be collected from patient hospital records.
- Length of hospital stay. Data on this outcome will be collected from patient hospital records.
- Intensive care unit admission. Data on this outcome will be collected from patient hospital records.
- Length of intensive care unit stay. Data on this outcome will be collected from patient hospital records.

## Handling of Adverse and Safety Events

<!--*Explain which adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will
be reported during the trial (compare with the Investigator's Brochure
for non-approved investigational medicinal products or SPC for approved
medications used according to the approved indication). Carefully
consider what should and should not be reported, and under which time
period of the trial that AE/SAE shall be reported. If the disease itself
causes certain symptoms, hospitalization, etc., these conditions can be
given as exceptions for what shall **[not]{.underline}** be reported as
an AE, SAE, or SUSAR.*

*AE and SAE are followed up until they are fully evaluated or no longer
considered clinically non-significant by the principal investigator
(described in section 9.2.1, Assessment of causal relationship, and
section 9.4, Follow-up of Adverse Events). Note that persistent adverse
events are classified as serious.*-->

### Definitions

#### Adverse Event

Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject and, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment, can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory discovery), symptom or disease temporally associated with the inclusion in the trial, whether or not related to the trial.

#### Serious Adverse Event

Any untoward medical occurrence in a trial participant that:

-   leads to death
-   is life-threatening
-   requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
-   results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
-   results in a congenital anomaly/malformation

#### Safety Event

Any unexpected serious complication that might occur as a consequence of the trial and that are not part of the natural history of trauma.

### Reporting and Assessment of Adverse and Safety Events

In alignment with other current trials including critically ill patients [@STEPCARE2023], we will not collect adverse events or serious adverse events, because many of these events are expected in this patient population and we already collect many of these events, for example mortality, as part of our outcomes. 

We will only report safety events, if they are life-threatening, prolong hospitalisation or result in meaningful harm to the participant. We cannot pre-define a comprehensive list of events that can be considered safety events, but will actively assess the presence of the following safety events:

- Prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 7 days)
- Initiation of renal replacement therapy
- Prolonged (> 2 days) or renewed (restart after at least 2 days without) use of vasopressors such as norepinephrine or vasopressin

These events are considered safety events because they suggest pulmonary, renal, septic or bleeding complications and an increase in their occurrence following ATLS^®^ training could indicate that the intervention is harmful. These events therefore need to be tracked during the standard care phase as well as the intervention phase, but will only be considered indicative of harm related to the intervention if they occur more often during the intervention phase than during the standard care phase. 

We will also report any other safety events that we identify during the trial, and the reporting of such will have to be based on the intuition of the clinical research coordinators and local investigators. Examples of such safety events could include missed injuries or missed investigations, which could be suspected if certain injuries or investigations were identified or conducted more often during the standard care phase than during the intervention phase.

All safety events will be recorded in the Case Record Form (CRF) and reported to the trial management team within 24 hours of its occurrence. The trial management team will then assess if the event can be considered related to the trial or the intervention within 24 hours of it being reported. Events that are considered probably related will be reported immediately to the Data Monitoring Committee. 

### Follow up of Safety Events

All safety events should be followed up by the local investigator until they are fully evaluated. 

<!--
### Assessment of Adverse Events (AE)

#### **Assessment of causal relationship** 

*Text suggestion:* The investigator is responsible for determining
whether there is a causal relationship between the AE/SAE and use of the
investigational medicinal product.

Consideration should be given to whether there is a reasonable
possibility of establishing a causal relationship between the adverse
event and the investigational medicinal product based on the analysis of
the available evidence.

All AE can be categorized as either likely related, possibly related,
unlikely related or not related, in accordance with the definitions
below:

**Likely related**: Clinical event, including abnormal results from
laboratory analyses, occurring within a reasonable time after
administration of the intervention/investigational medicinal product. It
is unlikely that the event can be attributed to underlying disease or
other medications but is most likely caused by the investigational
medicinal product and its emergence is reasonable in relationship with
use of the investigational medicinal product.

**Possibly related**: Clinical event, including abnormal results from
laboratory analyses, occurring within a reasonable time after
administration of the intervention/investigational medicinal product.
The event could be explained by the investigational medicinal product
and its emergence is reasonable in relationship with use of the
investigational medicinal product, but there is insufficient information
to determine the relationship. The event could be explained by an
underlying disease or other medications.

**Unlikely related**: Clinical event, including abnormal responses from
laboratory tests, unlikely to be related to the
intervention/investigational medicinal product and can be reasonably
explained by other medication or underlying disease.

**Not related**: Clinical event, including abnormal results from
laboratory analyses, that is not reasonably related to the use of the
intervention/investigational medicinal product.

Those AEs which are suspected of having a causal relationship to the
investigational medicinal product will be followed up until the subject
has recovered or is well taken care of and on the way to good recovery
(see also section 9.4, Follow-up of Adverse Events).

If the reporting investigator does not provide any information on
causality, the sponsor should consult with the reporting investigator
and encourage the expression of a position on this issue. The sponsor
must take into account the assessment of causality provided by the
investigator. If the sponsor disagrees with the investigator\'s
assessment of causality, both the investigator\'s and the sponsor\'s
views should be included in the report.

#### **Assessment of intensity**

*In addition to assessing the causal relationship between administration
of the investigational medicinal product and AE, an assessment of the
intensity of the event is required. The following classifications can be
used:*

Each adverse event shall be classified by an investigator as mild,
moderate or severe.

**Mild:** The adverse event is relatively tolerable and transient in
nature but does not affect the subject's normal life.

**Moderate**: The adverse event causes deterioration of function but
does not affect health. The event can be sufficiently unpleasant and
interferes with normal activities but does not completely obstruct them.

**Severe**: The adverse event causes deterioration of function or work
ability or poses a health risk to the subject.

*Assessment of intensity is generally made by the reporting
investigator.*

*Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) is another way to
classify intensity according to a five-point scale.*

#### **Assessment of seriousness**

The investigator is responsible for assessing the seriousness (serious
or non-serious). If the adverse event is considered serious, this should
be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) by the investigator to the
sponsor. See also section 9.3.2, Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
(SAE).

### Reporting and registration of Adverse Events

-   *The investigator should register and document adverse event or
    abnormal laboratory responses identified in the protocol as critical
    for safety assessment and report them to the sponsor according to
    the reporting requirements and within the time periods specified in
    the protocol.*

-   *Less stringent rules from registration and reporting requirements
    may be granted in low-intervention clinical trials (for definition
    see cover page) after a thorough risk analysis.*

-   *The sponsor should maintain a detailed register of all adverse
    event reported by the investigator.*

-   *Describe how AE/SAE are captured, e.g., that trial subjects at each
    contact with the investigator/nurse will be asked about how they
    have been feeling since the previous visit or describe if another
    way is used to capture adverse event in the trial.*

-   *Describe where AE/SAE are registered. Normally, they are registered
    primarily in the subject's medical records. Describe how these will
    be registered in the trial's CRF, reporting forms or worksheets, and
    where registrations of severity and causality are made, since this
    is not always done in the medical record.*

-   *Also describe AEs which do not need to be documented and reported
    as AEs. If this is not indicated, all adverse medical events should
    be collected as AEs in, e.g., a diary or otherwise.*

-   *Describe here during which time period adverse events are intended
    to be followed, e.g., from trial start or from start of treatment
    with the investigational medicinal product to XX weeks after the
    last dose.*

-   *All reported adverse events that have not been resolved by the end
    of the trial should be followed up. How, when, and for how long this
    follow-up will last should be described, e.g., telephone contact or
    visit to the study site approximately XX weeks after the last visit
    in the trial. The follow-up and the time for the follow-up
    visit/contact are adapted to each individual trial.*

-   ***Assessment of causal relationship (between AE/SAE and
    investigational medicinal product), whether the AE is considered to
    be an SAE or not, shall be made by a licensed physician.***

*Text suggestion:* At each trial visit, adverse events (AE) are
registered, starting after *trial start/or from start of treatment with
the investigational medicinal product,* up to and including *X* *weeks*
after the subject has ended their treatment with the investigational
medicinal product. All AE that occurs during the trial and which are
observed by the investigator/trial nurse or reported by the subject will
be registered in the CRF regardless of whether they are related to the
investigational medicinal product or not. Assessment of causal
relationship, severity, and whether the AE is considered to be an SAE
will be made by the investigator directly in the *CRF/on a
trial-specific worksheet*. At minimum for each AE/SAE, a description of
the event is recorded (diagnosis/symptom if diagnosis is missing), start
and stop dates, causal relationship, severity, if the AE is considered
to be an SAE, measures and outcome.

The following symptoms are clearly related to the process and the
expected course of the condition and therefore will not be reported as
AE:

Example:

*Expected adverse events based on knowledge of the disease in question
and expected clinical course.*

#### **Reporting of Adverse Events (AE)**

*Text suggestion:* All AE shall be registered in the CRF within
*\<\<indicate time frame\>\> as indicated above (section 9.3, Reporting
and registration of Adverse Events)*.

#### **Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)**

*Text suggestion:* Serious adverse events (SAE) are reported to the
sponsor on a special SAE form within 24 hours of the investigator being
informed of the SAE.

Follow-up information describing the outcome and handling of the SAE is
reported as soon as this information is available. The original should
be kept in the Investigator Site File.

*Provide details about the reporting procedure for SAE. Include
reporting times, what will happen upon receipt of an SAE, who will
review what is reported and who will assess whether the adverse event
was expected for the investigational medicinal product or not (this is
done using the reference safety information). The processes for
receiving, confirming, and reviewing of reported SAEs should be
described. Reviewing of SAEs must occur in due time, with consideration
of the reporting times for a potential SUSAR.*

*Add information about SAEs that should not be reported.*

*Text suggestion:* Based on knowledge of the disease in question and
expected clinical course, some events that are otherwise serious are not
considered as SAEs in this trial. The following is a list of SAEs that
shall not be reported as SAEs:

**Example:**

1.  *Expected events based on the knowledge of the disease in question
    and expected clinical course.*

2.  *If a trial subject is hospitalized with a documented cancer-related
    problem, this will not be reported as an SAE.*

#### **Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR)**

*In investigator-initiated trials where non-commercial sponsors lack the
possibility to report SUSAR directly in the EudraVigilance database, the
Swedish Medical Products Agency can help with this when a SUSAR occurs
in Sweden. However, this must be clearly justified in the cover letter
to the application. Reporting then takes place via the [CIOMS
form](https://cioms.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cioms-form1.pdf) which
is sent to the Swedish Medical Products Agency via Eudralink. Since
these reports contain personal data, they should not be sent to the
Swedish Medical Products Agency via normal email.*

*The reference safety information provides the basis for assessing
whether the adverse reaction is unexpected or not.*

*SUSARs should, if possible, be reported unblinded, that is, should
state to which trial medicinal product the subject had a reaction. The
investigator should only unblind the treatment allocation for a subject
if unblinding is relevant to the subject\'s safety. Unblinded data
should only be available to persons who need to participate in safety
reporting to the regulatory authority and Data Safety Monitoring Boards
(DSMBs) or to persons performing ongoing safety evaluations during the
clinical trial. Placebo should only be reported if it is suspected that
any component of the placebo treatment has caused the reaction.*

*Text suggestion:* Those SAE which are assessed by sponsor to be SUSAR
are reported via a [CIOMS
form](https://cioms.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cioms-form1.pdf) to
the EudraVigilance database / Swedish Medical Products Agency according
to the specified time frames.

SUSAR that are fatal or life-threatening are reported as soon as
possible and no later than 7 days after the serious adverse event has
become known to the sponsor. Relevant follow-up information is sent
thereafter within an additional 8 days. Other SUSAR are reported as soon
as possible and no later than 15 days after they have come to the
sponsor's knowledge.

*Multicentre trials:* Information about SUSAR occurring during the trial
is compiled by the sponsor and sent to the principal investigators at
all participating sites. *In order to preserve the integrity of the
trial, it is recommended that reporting of SUSAR to investigators in a
blinded study is made without unblinding, that is, without specifying
which investigational medicinal product the subject received. Describe
how the reporting will be done.*

### Follow-up of Adverse Events

*Describe the follow-up of trial subjects who have been affected by
adverse events (AE/SAE) (until the adverse event is
resolved/stable/persistent) and measures in case of unacceptable adverse
events (dose adjustment, treatment interruption, withdrawal of subject
from the trial). Describe follow-up of subjects with regards to safety
after the trial is completed.*

## Statistics

### General principles

We will conduct all analysis by modified intention to treat. Clusters and observations within clusters will be considered exposed to the intervention after the date at which the cluster was scheduled to transition. All data will be included with the exception of the transition phases. We will not adjust for multiplicity of analyses because none of the secondary outcomes will be singularly more important. However, all secondary outcomes will be interpreted with due consideration for how all are affected by the intervention without putting any undue emphasis on a single outcome that might be statistically significant but where all others appear to have remained unchanged. 

We will use a two-sided significance level of 5% and estimate 95% confidence intervals. The primary subgroup analyses will be based on geographical region because demonstrating the consistency of any effect across multiple regions will enhance the generalisibility of the results[^question:batch-region]. Additional subgroup analyses will include age across the groups older adolescents (15-19 years), young adults (20-24 years), adults (25-59 years), and older adults (60 years and older) [@Diaz2021]; sex; and the clinical cohorts blunt multisytem trauma, penetrating trauma, and severe isolated traumatic brain injury.

[^question:batch-region]: **Note:** Batches will not be based on regions because it will be logistically more feasible to include clusters from different regions in each batch. 

### Analysis models

There are a number of requirements for the analysis model. Firstly, all analysis will consider the clustered nature of the design. Secondly, as the trial has only `r clusters` clusters, it will be essential that the model allows for a correction due to the small number of clusters. Thirdly, as the design is a stepped-wedge study, we will adjust for temporal confounding using categorical effects for period of the study (month). Full details on how each of these will be undertaken, with justification is provided below [@Li2020]. 

For binary outcomes, a mixed effects binomial regression with a logit link will be used to estimate the odds ratio; and a binomial model with identity link used to estimate the risk difference. These models will be fitted using residual pseudo-likelihood estimation based on linearization with subject-specific expansion (RSPL). If the binomial model with the identity link does not converge then only a odds ratio will be reported. 

We will include fixed effects for period and a fixed effect for intervention exposure. The primary analysis will allow for clustering by as a random cluster and random cluster by period effect. To correct the potential inflation of the type I error rate due to small number of clusters, the Kenward and Roger small sample correction will be used. In a sensitivity analysis we will explore if models with more complicated correlation structures are a better fit to the data. These models are not being used as our primary analysis models as there is limited understanding as to when such models will converge and how to choose between the various different correlation structures which might be plausible.

To this end we will additionally fit generalised linear mixed models (with same link functions and fixed effects as described above) to include a discrete time decay correlation structure including a random cluster effect with auto-regressive structure (AR(1)). To allow for the randomisation by batches, a different secular trend will be included for each batch (interaction between batch and period). For continuous, count and prevalence outcomes similar model-based approaches will be used but with appropriate links and distribution functions, using transformations where appropriate. 

### Additional sensitivity analyses

To additionally explore if the fixed period effect is both parsimonious and adequate to represent the extent of any underlying secular trend, we will model the time effect using a spline function. Models will also be extended to include random cluster by intervention effects (with a non-zero covariance term) to examine if results are sensitive to the assumption of no intervention by cluster interaction. Models will also be extended to include an interaction between treatment and number of periods since first treated, to examine if there is any indication of a relationship between duration of exposure to the intervention and outcomes. 

This will allow us to different lag effects (whereby it takes time for the intervention to become embedded within the culture before its impact can properly start to be realised); as well as waning effects (whereby the effect of the intervention starts to decrease – or fade).  This type of analysis attempts to disentangle how some clusters end up having a long exposure to the intervention and others have a much shorter exposure time. A fully adjusted covariate analysis will additionally adjust for a set of pre-specified individual-level covariates of known prognostic importance. 

### Estimation and reporting of within cluster correlations

We will report time adjusted within-cluster correlations for all outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. We will report correlations from the different assumed correlation structures (so we will report intra-cluster correlations (ICC); within and between-period correlations; and within-period correlations and exponential decay). As well as reporting correlations we will additionally report all variance components. For all outcomes we will report correlations on the latent scale (i.e. proportions scale for binary outcomes) as is appropriate to inform future sample size calculations.  

### Sample size calculations

```{r sample-size}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
get_design_matrix(
    clusters = clusters,
    sequences = sequences,
    batches = batches,
    min.standard.care.months = min.standard.care.months,
    min.intervention.months = min.intervention.months,
    batches.overlap.months = batches.overlap.months,
    transition.months = transition.months,
    transition.overlap.months = transition.overlap.months,
    total.months = total.months
)
```

With `r clusters` clusters and a total sample size of `r sample.size` our study has ~90% power across different combinations of cluster autocorrelations (CAC) and intra-cluster correlations (ICC) to detect a reduction in the primary outcome from 20% under standard care to 15% after ATLS^®^ training (see @fig-power-curves). This effect is a conservative estimate and the reduction equals a risk ratio of 0.75, which would be clinically important while also being consistent with our pilot study and updated systematic review. We allowed for the clustered design and assumed an ICC of 0.02, but considered sensitivity across the range 0.01-0.05 [@Campbell2005; @Eldridge2015], and a CAC of 0.9 but considered sensitivity across the range 0.8-1.0, based on our pilot study and current guidance [@Hemming2020Feb; @Martin2016; @Korevaar2021]. We included the CAC to allow for variation in clustering over time. We assume that each cluster will contribute approximately `r observations.per.month` observations per month to the analysis, based on our previous work. 

```{r power-curves}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-power-curves
#| fig.cap: "Power curves for different combinations of cluster autocorrelations (CAC) and intra-cluster correlations (ICC). **A)** Shows power curves assuming a reduction in the primary outcome from 20% under standard care to 15% after ATLS^®^ training. **B)** Shows power curves assuming a reduction in the primary outcome from 10% under standard care to 7.5% after ATLS^®^ training. Under this scenario, we would need to increase the sample size per month to around 30 observations to achieve 90% powere under most combinations of CAC and ICC."

```

### Interim analysis

There will be one interim analyses after half of the batches have completed the trial. The first purpose of this interim analysis will be to assess the trial's feasibility and recommend stopping the trial if the trial is not feasible, for example if clusters fail to adhere to the randomisation schedule or if there are substantial missing data in outcomes. The second purpose of the interim analysis will be to assess if sample size calculations should be revised, primarily by increasing the number of clusters to be included. The interim analyses will be assessed by the Data Monitoring Committee.

## Quality Control and Quality Assurance

The George Institute for Global Health - India will ensure proper conduct of the trial through quality control measures including on-site training of personnel, standard operating procedures, ongoing quality metrics assessment, review of missing data and outliers, and round-the-clock availability of coordinating center personnel and Principal Investigators. The trial will strictly follow ICH GCP principles, Indian regulations, and George Institute procedures. The trial operations staff from the George Institute India will train local investigators, and trial site staff, before the trial, with continuous documentation in the site master file. All documentation will be stored securely and retained according to regulatory requirements. 

## Quality Assurance and Oversight

The Trial Management Group and Trial Team, comprising key project leaders and managers, will play a pivotal role in ensuring the highest standards of quality assurance and effective sponsor oversight throughout the trial. These groups will be responsible for facilitating consistent communication, maintaining fidelity in study implementation, and overseeing the quality of data collection. 

To achieve these objectives, the groups will implement a comprehensive communication plan and provide extensive training to site personnel. The training will cover not only the study protocol but also practical aspects of various systems, supplemented by both written and electronic materials designed to educate study and clinical emergency staff.

The trial's quality assurance systems will be meticulously designed based on a thorough risk analysis. A key component of our quality assurance strategy will include the development and implementation of detailed operational manuals and regular meetings. These tools and interactions will ensure that all trial personnel will be used to uphold the trial's quality standards.

Central to our oversight approach will be a comprehensive monitoring and auditing plan. This plan will be tailored based on the identified risks associated with the trial. Through these comprehensive measures, the trial management group, in conjunction with the hospital staff, will ensure that the trial is conducted with the utmost rigor, adhering to the highest standards of quality assurance and effective sponsor oversight.

## Monitoring

We will implement a multi-tiered monitoring strategy, including centralized data consistency checks, statistical monitoring, and selective on-site evaluations. Key integrity measures include source data verification, data entry validation, and regular audits. Any protocol deviations will be thoroughly documented, with serious breaches promptly addressed to ensure data integrity

Monitors from coordinating centres will assist investigators in maintaining high ethical, scientific, technical, and regulatory quality. Monitoring visits will review protocol adherence, participant recruitment, adverse event reporting, compliance with study procedures, and regulatory adherence. Regular remote monitoring of the web-based database will be conducted to ensure data integrity, using validation and consistency rules and regular data cleaning.

# Deviations, serious breaches and other reporting obligations

The responsible investigator shall, without delay, report to the sponsor any serious breaches and deviations from the trial protocol, ICH-GCP and other regulations that significantly and directly affect, or with high likelihood could affect, the subjects' safety and integrity or the reliability and robustness of the data generated in the trial. The sponsor should assess the suspected serious breach and the consequences of deviations that have occurred. Minor deviations that do not affect subjects' integrity or safety, nor significantly affect the trial's scientific value, are documented in the trial documentation of the principal investigator and the sponsor and appropriate measures shall be taken. The deviations must be recorded in the clinical trial report.

# Audits and inspections 

Authorized representatives for the sponsor and Competent Authorities (CA) may carry out audits or inspections at the trial site, including source data verification. The investigator must ensure that all source documents are available for audits and inspections. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently review all trial-related activities and documents, to determine whether these activities were performed, registered, analyzed and reported correctly according to protocol, ICH- GCP and applicable regulations.

# Ethics

## Compliance to the protocol, ICH-GCP and regulations

The trial will be performed in compliance with this clinical trial protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH-GCP (Good Clinical Practice), and current national regulations governing this clinical trial. This is to ensure the safety and integrity of the trial subjects as well as the quality of the data
collected.

## Ethical review of the trial

The final protocol will be submitted for ethical review at all participating hospitals, where possible, as well as the The George Institute for Global Health in India and Swedish Ethical Review Atuhortiy.

## Procedure for obtaining consent

We will use an opt-out consent approach, in which consent is presumed unless actively declined. Note that the consent here refers to consent for data collection, because it will not be possible for patients to opt out from being subjected to the intervention, as the intervention is delivered at the cluster level and involves training physicians in trauma life support, and these physicians cannot be expected to temporarily forget their training.

This approach is justified because the trial can be considered minimal risk and because data collection will be non-invasive and mostly rely on extraction of routinely collected data from medical records. Clinical research coordinators will inform patient participants about the study and they will be given the opportunity have their data deleted before final data analysis. 

The clinical research coordinators will approach patients or patient representatives to provide this information in person after admission. If a patient is transferred to another hospital before the patient has had an opportunity to receive the study information, then the clinical research coordinators will contact the patient or patient representative by phone.

## Data protection

All data will be handled according to the Indian Council of Medical Research's guidelines and standard operating procedures of the George Institute for Global Health India on data security and protection. Trial data will be shared via the trial electronic CRF (eCRF) throughout the trial.  The eCRF will be accessible via VPN with a two-factor authentication and the data will be held on a secure server. All investigators and trial site staff involved in this trial must comply with the requirements of the ICMR Guidelines on data security and protection. The participant information sheet provided to participants, will inform them how:

- the trial data will be collected, used and disclosed;
- how trial data are stored to maintain confidentiality in accordance with national data legislation; and
- for verification of the data, representatives delegated by the sponsor, as well as relevant authorities, may require access to parts of medical records or trial records that are relevant to the trial, including the patient participant's medical history.

# Insurances

The George Institute for Global Health, India is responsible for ensuring that any insurance cover required to cover the set-up, management and conduct of the study in India has been obtained. The George Institute for Global Health, India is also responsible for ensuring that India Sites have been obtained and/or will obtain insurance prior to the opening of the study in India and shall be maintained for the duration of the study and for an appropriate period thereafter.  This includes being responsible for ensuring that there is appropriate insurance for the duration of the study to cover against claims for compensation by participants arising out of their participation in the trial in India. Compensation in case of injury or death will be provided by the George Institute for Global Health, India according to the regulations outlined in rules 39, 40 and 42 of the New Drugs and Clinical Rules (2019).  x

# Substantial changes to the trial

Substantial changes to the signed clinical trial protocol are only possible through approved protocol amendments and by agreement between the sponsor and the principal investigator.

# Collection, handling, and archiving of data

Clinical research coordinators will collect data using a paper based CRF (see Appendix @sec-appendix-case-record-form), which is then transferred to an eCRF. All trial data in the CRF must be extracted from and be consistent with the relevant source documents. The eCRF will be accessible to trial coordinators, data managers, the Investigators, Clinical Trial Monitors, Auditors, and Inspectors as required. All data will be registered, managed, and stored in a manner that enables correct reporting, interpretation, and verification. The complete Trial Master File, as well as source documents, will be archived for at least 10 years after the trial is completed. Source data in the medical records system are stored and archived in accordance with national regulations. Metadata will be publicly accessible via a persistent DOI, and anonymised data will be released upon project completion. A detailed data management plan is available here [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7748764](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7748764). 

## Source data

The source data for each variable is given in @sec-variables. Whenever medical records are the source data, this includes imaging and lab reports. Whenever an interview is given as the source, the CRF will constitute the source data, as this is where the responses to questions will be recorded. The local investigator must keep source documents for each patient participant in the trial. A document describing what has been classified as source data in the trial (source data reference document) will be included in the Investigator Site File (ISF). The investigator must ensure that all source documents are accessible for monitoring and other quality control activities. Source data is further defined before trial start at each individual site and can, in cases where source data is not registered in another document, consist of the CRF. This should be decided in consultation with the monitor and clearly stated in the source data reference document. Access to trial-related documentation, such as patient participants' medical records, CRFs, other source data and other trial documentation will be provided for monitoring and auditing purposes. Access will also be granted in the context of regulatory inspections.

## Variables {#sec-variables}

<!--
**If we want to be able to do a cost-effectiveness analysis, then we also need to collect data on who does what for how long, capture changes in expensive procedures and investigations, capture health care utilisation after discharge, in-formal care (who does the caring, when and for how long), and productivity losses. There may be instruments for this already, or we can adapt existing instruments. To capture potential equity aspects we also need socioeconomic information on the patients**

<!--
*From the protocol it must be clear how the data will be collected.
Describe which other types of data collection documents, in addition to
the CRF, are used, e.g.: diaries, quality of life questionnaires, health
economics, different patient-reported outcomes measures, etc. Describe
how corrections will occur and by whom, that there will be an
independent copy of the CRF with the investigator when the trial is
completed, and how other trial documentation is stored and who has
access to it. The sponsor and investigator must archive the information
in the Trial Master File for at least 25 years after the end of the
clinical trial, providing that a longer archiving period follows from
other parts of the law. The sponsor and investigator can also agree that
the documents shall be archived for a longer period. The Swedish
Archives Act (Arkivlagen) applies to archiving of research material. For
clinical trials in ATMP (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product), the
archiving period is 30 years according to GCP specific for ATMP.*

*The sponsor and the investigator shall keep a Clinical trial master
file with documentation for the whole trial. The clinical trial master
file shall at all times contain the essential documents relating to that
clinical trial which allow verification of the conduct of a clinical
trial and the quality of the data generated, taking into account all
characteristics of the clinical trial, including in particular whether
the clinical trial is a low-intervention clinical trial. It shall be
readily available, and directly accessible upon request, to the Member
States.*

*The clinical trial master file kept by the investigator and that kept
by the sponsor may have a different content if this is justified by the
different nature of the responsibilities of the investigator and the
sponsor. The principal investigator shall keep an Investigator Site File
(part of the Clinical Trial Master File) with all trial documentation
for the site. The files should have relevant content according to the
trial and follow ICH-GCP chapter 8 "Essential documents". The principal
investigator will store the trial site's data, subject identification
list, original of the subject information sheet and obtained trial
consent inaccessible to unauthorized persons, but such that trial
subjects can be identified by those responsible for the trial. This
information must not be stored at the sponsor.*

*For information about data protection see section 12.4, Data
protection.*

*Text suggestion:*

Subjects who participate in the trial are coded with a trial-specific
identification number. All subjects are registered in a subject
identification list (subject enrolment and identification list) that
connects the subject's name and personal number with a subject
number/trial identification number.

All data will be registered, managed, and stored in a manner that
enables correct reporting, interpretation, and verification. The
complete Trial Master File, as well as source documents, will be
archived for at least *25* years after the trial is completed. Source
data in the medical records system are stored and archived in accordance
with national regulations.

# Notification of trial completion, reporting, and publication

The trial will be reported to the Funders within a year of completion. The results of the trial will also be prepared as manuscripts for publication. Authorship on trial manuscripts will be based on the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria [@icmje_2024]: 

> - Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
> - Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content; AND
> - Final approval of the version to be published; AND
> - Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
>
> In addition to being accountable for the parts of the work done, an author should be able to identify which co-authors are responsible for specific other parts of the work. In addition, authors should have confidence in the integrity of the contributions of their co-authors.

The most recent version of the ICMJE criteria will be adhered to. We will also use the ICMJE criteria for non-author contributorship.

Before work on a trial manuscript is initiated, a writing group will be formed and first and last authors will be designated. This writing group will be formed by discussion in the Trial Management Group. 

<!--
*The sponsor must notify, via CTIS, each concerned Member State that a
clinical trial involving that Member State has been terminated.
Notification must also be made when a trial has been terminated in all
participating EU countries and also when termination has occurred in all
participating third countries. The notification must be made within 15
days.*

*Within one year of the completion of the clinical trial in all Member
States, the sponsor must submit a summary of the results of the clinical
trial to CTIS, regardless of the outcome of the trial.*

*Guidance on content can be found in the CTR
([Link](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SV/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0536)),
Annex IV. It should be accompanied by a summary written in a way that is
understandable to lay people. The content of the summary is given in CTR
([Link](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SV/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0536)),
Annex V.*

*For clinical trials involving children, the above summaries must be
submitted within six months of the end of the trial. This shortened
deadline of six months applies to sponsors who are marketing
authorisation holders for the medicinal product.*

*If the trial is submitted for marketing authorization of an
investigational medicinal product, the applicant for marketing
authorisation must also, in addition to the summary of results, submit
the full clinical trial report to CTIS within 30 days of the decision
being taken.*

*In addition to submitting a summary of the results to CTIS a complete
report with individual data shall be available from the sponsor on
request or for any inspections by the Swedish Medical Products Agency
throughout the entire retention period. A published article is not to be
equated with a summary of a report. The report must contain sufficient
information so that the Swedish Medical Products Agency can make an
evaluation.*

*In addition to submitting a summary of the results to CTIS, a full
clinical trial report with individual data shall be completed by the
sponsor and provided to Principal investigators. The clinical trial
report shall be archived in the Trial Master File by the sponsor and by
the principal investigator at each site, in their Investigator Site
Files, throughout the entire retention period, and available on request
for inspections by the authorities. The clinical trial report must
contain sufficient information so that the Swedish Medical Products
Agency or other authorities can make a complete evaluation of the trial
conduct and the results. A published article is not to be equated with
the summary report to CTIS or the full clinical trial report.*

*The sponsor is responsible for the compilation of statistical analyses
and their presentation to involved principal investigators. These
analyses may be the basis for a manuscript for publication.*

*If the results are summarized in a manuscript with the purpose to
publish in a scientific journal, it is recommended that the EU trial
number is stated at the end of the abstract. This clearly documents that
the trial has been published in advance and meets the requirements from
ICMJE (International Committee for Medical Journal Editors) that are set
for publications in medical science journals.*

*If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely terminated due to a
change in the risk-benefit balance, for reasons of subject safety, this
must be notified to the Member States concerned through CTIS. The
notification should be made as soon as possible, but not later than 15
days after the clinical trial was suspended or terminated prematurely.
The reasons for such action and follow-up measures must be provided. The
resumption of a clinical trial after its temporary interruption due to a
change in the benefit/risk balance is considered a substantial
modification.*

*Interruptions that do not affect the benefit/risk relationship must be
notified, via CTIS, within 15 days, stating the reason for the
interruption. Notification of restart shall be made, via CTIS, within 15
days.See also section* *5.4,* *End of Trial, as well as section* *6.4,*
*Withdrawal criteria.*

*Text suggestion:*

End of the trial is reported in CTIS at the latest 15 days after
completion.

Within one year of trial completion, a clinical study report is
completed, and a summary of the clinical trial results must be reported
in CTIS, including a summary for lay people.
