	abstract = {Trauma, a global health challenge, remains a significant cause of mortality despite advances in trauma management. The establishment of trauma teams has revolutionized care in trauma resuscitation. The training of these teams is designed to promote self-trust and empower trainees in trauma care, enhance performance, and improve patient outcomes. Various training curricula have been developed, utilizing a plethora of teaching methods such as lectures, simulations, debriefings, skill workshops, and demonstrations. However, a universally accepted gold standard curriculum in trauma training is yet to be defined, and there is no standard method for delivering education in injury care teaching. In this review, we have examined relevant literature data on standard teaching programs, the educational delivery methods used, and their impact on adult trauma patients’ outcomes and trained team-related outcomes. While most studies indicate improved trained team performance, they consistently show no improvement in patient-specific outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, and length of stay. However, data hints at optimal educational delivery and the role that technology may play in the future of trauma training development.},

	abstract = {Background: Due to complex geography and resource constraints, trauma patients are often initially transported to community or rural facilities rather than a larger Level I or II trauma center. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize evidence on interventions that improved the quality of trauma care and/or reduced healthcare costs at non-Level I or II facilities.
Methods: A scoping review was performed to identify studies implementing a Quality Improvement (QI) initiative at a non-major trauma center (i.e., non-Level I or II trauma center [or equivalent]). We searched 3 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and the grey literature (relevant networks, organizations/associations). Methodological quality was evaluated using NIH and JBI study quality assessment tools. Studies were included if they evaluated the effect of implementing a trauma care QI initiative on one or more of the following: 1) trauma outcomes (mortality, morbidity); 2) system outcomes (e.g., length of stay [LOS], transfer times, provider factors); 3) provider knowledge or perception; or 4) healthcare costs. Pediatric trauma, pre-hospital and tele-trauma specific studies were excluded.
Results: Of 1046 data sources screened, 36 were included for full review (29 journal articles, 7 abstracts/posters without full text). Educational initiatives including the Rural Trauma Team Development Course and the Advanced Trauma Life Support course were the most common QI interventions investigated. Study outcomes included process metrics such as transfer time to tertiary care and hospital LOS, along with measures of provider perception and knowledge. Improvement in mortality was reported in a single study evaluating the impact of establishing a dedicated trauma service at a community hospital.
Conclusions: Our review captured a broad spectrum of trauma QI projects implemented at non-major trauma centers. Educational interventions did result in process outcome improvements and high rates of self-reported improvements in trauma care. Given the heterogeneous capabilities of community and rural hospitals, there is no panacea for trauma QI at these facilities. Future research should focus on patient outcomes like mortality and morbidity, and locally relevant initiatives.},

                METHODS: Single-center prospective observational cohort study. The study included all emergency department patients aged 18 years or older who received resuscitation from the TT. Virtual meeting was held with the TT using SD to review one trauma patient resuscitation video. Technical skills improvement was based on adherence to the ATLS protocol and non-technical skills based on T-NOTECHS scale.
                RESULTS: There was statistically significant improvement in adherence to the ATLS protocol: 73\% [55-82\%] vs 91\% [82-100\%] (p {\textless} 0.001); and improvement in T-NOTECHS scale: 12 [10-14] vs 16 [14-19] points (p {\textless} 0.001).
                CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that structured debriefings with review of patients' resuscitation video recordings can have a significant positive impact on trauma team performance in the emergency department in both technical and non-technical skills.},

	abstract = {Background Trauma contributes more than ten percent of the global burden of disease. Initial assessment and resuscitation of trauma patients often requires rapid diagnosis and management of multiple concurrent complex conditions, and errors are common. We investigated whether implementing a trauma care checklist would improve care for injured patients in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.
Methods From 2010 to 2012, the impact of the World Health Organization (WHO) Trauma Care Checklist program was assessed in 11 hospitals using a stepped wedge pre- and post-intervention comparison with randomly assigned intervention start dates. Study sites represented nine countries with diverse economic and geographic contexts. Primary end points were adherence to process of care measures; secondary data on morbidity and mortality were also collected. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in measures pre- versus post-intervention, accounting for patient age, gender, injury severity, and center-speciﬁc variability.
Results Data were collected on 1641 patients before and 1781 after program implementation. Patient age (mean 34 ± 18 vs. 34 ± 18), sex (21 vs. 22 \% female), and the proportion of patients with injury severity scores (ISS) C 25 (10 vs. 10 \%) were similar before and after checklist implementation (p [ 0.05). Improvement was found for 18 of 19 process measures, including greater odds of having abdominal examination (OR 3.26), chest auscultation (OR 2.68), and distal pulse examination (OR 2.33) (all p {\textbackslash} 0.05). These changes were robust to several sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions Implementation of the WHO Trauma Care Checklist was associated with substantial improvements in patient care process measures among a cohort of patients in diverse settings.},

Trauma quality improvement programmes may reduce adverse patient outcomes but lack robust evidence. This study assessed the effect of implementing a trauma quality improvement programme using audit filters on health-related quality of life in adult trauma patients in urban India.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We conducted a controlled interrupted time series study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03235388) across four tertiary care university hospitals. Adult (≥18 years) trauma patients, who were alive at 90 days post-admission, were included. After a 14-month observation phase, two hospitals were randomized to the intervention arm and implemented the trauma quality improvement programme, while two control hospitals did not implement any interventions. The study spanned from 2017 to 2022.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Health-related quality of life was assessed 90 days post-admission using the EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The main outcome was EQ-5D health status, scaled from 0 to 100, analyzed using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. Descriptive analysis was performed for the five individual EQ-5D dimensions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}2307 participants were eligible for the analyses. The DiD analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the EQ-5D health status score in the intervention arm (DiD estimate −4.07 [95\% CI: −7.00; −1.15]). For the 819 patients with major trauma, there was a more pronounced, but statistically insignificant reduction (DiD estimate −4.86 [95\% CI: −9.87; 0.15]). In the intervention arm, mobility, self-care, and pain/discomfort improved, while usual activities and anxiety/depression worsened.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Implementing trauma quality improvement programmes using audit filters may reduce the average health-related quality of life of trauma patients if more severely injured patients survive, highlighting the importance of assessing quality of life after the implementation of such programmes and ensuring adequate rehabilitation resources to support long-term recovery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objectives: The 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) provides a standardised method for measuring health and disability. This study aimed to determine its reliability, validity and responsiveness and to establish the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in critically ill patients. Design: Prospective, multicentre cohort study. Setting: Intensive care units of six metropolitan hospitals. Participants: Adults mechanically ventilated for {\textgreater} 24 hours. Main outcome measures: Reliability was assessed by measuring internal consistency. Construct validity was assessed by comparing WHODAS 2.0 scores at 6 months with the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale scores. Responsiveness was evaluated by assessing change over time, effect sizes, and percentage of patients showing no change. The MCID was calculated using both anchor and distribution-based methods with triangulation of results. Main results: A baseline and 6-month WHODAS 2.0 score were available for 448 patients. The WHODAS 2.0 demonstrated good correlation between items with no evidence of item redundancy. Cronbach α coefficient was 0.91 and average split-half coefficient was 0.91. There was a moderate correlation between the WHODAS 2.0 and the EQ VAS scores (r = -0.72; P {\textless} 0.001) and between the WHODAS 2.0 and the Lawton IADL scores (r = -0.66; P {\textless} 0.001) at 6 months. The effect sizes for change in the WHODAS 2.0 score from baseline to 3 months and from 3 to 6 months were low. Ceiling effects were not present and floor effects were present at baseline only. The final MCID estimate was 10\%. Conclusion: The 12-item WHODAS 2.0 is a reliable, valid and responsive measure of disability in critically ill patients. A change in the total WHODAS 2.0 score of 10\% represents the MCID.},
