<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Synopsis</h1>
<p><strong>Title</strong> Effects of Advanced Trauma Life Support<sup>Â®</sup> Training Compared to Standard Care on Adult Trauma Patient Outcomes: A Cluster Randomised Trial</p>
<!-- **Acronym** -->
<p><strong>Rationale</strong> Trauma is a massive global health issue. Many training programmes have been developed to help physicians in the initial management of trauma patients. Among these programmes, Advanced Trauma Life Support<sup>Â®</sup> (ATLS<sup>Â®</sup>) is the most popular, having trained over one million physicians worldwide. Despite its widespread use, there are no controlled trials showing that ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> improves patient outcomes. Multiple systematic reviews emphasise the need for such trials.</p>
<p><strong>Aim</strong> To compare the effects of ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training with standard care on outcomes in adult trauma patients.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Outcome</strong> All-cause mortality within 30 days of arrival at the emergency department.</p>
<p><strong>Trial Design</strong> Batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial in India.</p>
<p><strong>Trial Population</strong> Adult trauma patients presenting to the emergency department of a participating hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Size</strong> 30 clusters and 4320 patients.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Hospitals</em> are secondary or tertiary hospitals in India that admit or refer/transfer for admission at least 400 patients with trauma per year.</p>
<p><em>Clusters</em> are one or more units of physicians providing initial trauma care in the emergency department of tertiary hospitals in India.</p>
<p><em>Patients participants</em> are adult trauma patients who presents to the emergency department of participating hospitals and are admitted or transferred for admission.</p>
<p><strong>Intervention</strong> The intervention will be ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training, a proprietary 2.5 day course teaching a standardised approach to trauma patient care using the concepts of a primary and secondary survey. Physicians will be trained in an accredited ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training facility in India.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong> We will use an opt-out consent approach for collection of routinely recorded data. We will obtain informed consent for collection of non-routinely recorded data, such as quality of life and disability outcomes. Patients who are unconscious or lack a legally authorized representative will be included under a waiver of informed consent. Note that consent here refers to consent to data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Trial Period</strong> October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2029</p>

<p>Several trauma life support training programmes have been developed to improve the early management of patients in the hospital by providing a structured framework for assessment and treatment<span class="citation" data-cites="Mohammad2013 Jayaraman2014 Kadhum2020 Jin2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Mohammad2013" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>â<a href="#ref-Jin2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. The proprietary Advanced Trauma Life Support<sup>Â®</sup> (ATLS<sup>Â®</sup>) is the most established trauma life support training programme and more than one million physicians in over 80 countries have been trained in the programme since the first course in 1978<span class="citation" data-cites="acsAtls2018"><sup><a href="#ref-acsAtls2018" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>. In the US and many other countries training in ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> is virtually mandatory for trauma care physicians<span class="citation" data-cites="ACS2022"><sup><a href="#ref-ACS2022" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span>.

<p>There are three randomised controlled studies showing that ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> improves knowledge and clinical skills<span class="citation" data-cites="Ali1995 Ali1996 Ali1999"><sup><a href="#ref-Ali1995" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>â<a href="#ref-Ali1999" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span>, but there are no randomised controlled trials or high-quality quasi-experimental trials indicating that ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> improves patient outcomes<span class="citation" data-cites="Mohammad2013 Jayaraman2014 Jin2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Mohammad2013" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a href="#ref-Jayaraman2014" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>,<a href="#ref-Jin2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. We conducted an updated systematic review for project (unpublished), and estimated a pooled risk ratio of 0.82 (95% CI 0.60; 1.11) from ten heterogeneous (I<sup>2</sup> 0.91) retrospective or small studies on the effect of ATLS on mortality (see <a href="#fig-forest-plot">Figure&nbsp;1</a>)<span class="citation" data-cites="Vestrup1988 Ariyanayagam1992 Ali1993 Olson2001 vanOlden2004 Wang2010 Drimousis2011 Hashmi2013 Petroze2014 Bellanova2016"><sup><a href="#ref-Vestrup1988" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>â<a href="#ref-Bellanova2016" role="doc-biblioref">25</a></sup></span>. No study assessed functional outcomes.</p>
<p>We conducted a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05417243) that we conducted between April 2022 and February 2023 as part of our network grant to assess the feasibility of a full scale trial. We published the protocol for this pilot study<span class="citation" data-cites="GerdinWÃ¤rnberg2022"><sup><a href="#ref-GerdinWÃ¤rnberg2022" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span>. Our pilot study enrolled 376 patients from seven hospitals across India (unpublished data) and shows that it is feasible to conduct the proposed trial with a high percentage of patients consenting to out of hospital follow up (78%), low loss to follow-up rate (1%), and low missingness in key variables (mean 0.8%).</p>
<p>To involve patients and the public in the planning of this trial we conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with trauma patients, caregivers, and community representatives (unpublished data). The aim of these interviews was to understand their views on the trial and important outcomes and the interviews showed high acceptability of our research and emphasised the importance of better recovery before discharge and functional outcomes at and after discharge, including pain, mobility and self-care activities. The interviews also highlighted return to work as an important outcome.</p>

<p>The direct risks includes integrity violations and data leakage. We will mitigate these risks by employing rigorous data collection and storage mechanisms. The procedures that we will use to collect data will be direct observation of care, routine physical examinations, questionnaires, and extraction of already collected data from patient records, which are often seen as involving only minimal risk.</p>
<p>The long-term risks of the research and the risk that the research will be used in detrimental ways are minimal. Our trial will assess the effect of Advanced Trauma Life Support<sup>Â®</sup> (ATLS<sup>Â®</sup>) on patient outcomes. Training in ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> is standard in many health care systems and it is unlikely that training physicians in this programme induces any harm to participants.</p>
<p>We consider these risks weighed up by the potential direct benefit for the participants in the intervention phase, if ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> is found to improve patient outcomes, and by the potential for improved care for the trauma patient population.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overall-trial-design"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Overall trial design</h2>
<p>We will conduct a batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial (see <a href="#fig-trial-design">Figure&nbsp;2</a>). The stepped-wedge trial is a uni-directional cross-over trial but the time point when clusters cross-over from standard care to the intervention is randomised<span class="citation" data-cites="Hemming2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Hemming2015" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span>. Each cluster will be at least one unit of physicians performing initial resuscitation of trauma patients in the emergency department of tertiary hospitals in India. The number of units that we will train in each hospital will depend on the sizes of these units and the volumes of patients that they see. If more than one unit is trained in the same hospital these units will be considered one unit for the purpose of randomization. We choose this approach for two reasons: 1) it will not be logistically or financially feasible to train all physician in a given hospital; and 2) we need to balance cluster size with the number of clusters. We will conduct this trial in India because physicians providing initial trauma care in India are so far not routinely trained in ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> or similar programmes.</p>
<p>We will roll out the interventions to 30 clusters over six batches, so there will be five clusters in each batch. The clusters in each batch will be randomised to one of five implementation sequences, with one hospital randomised to each implementation sequence. All clusters will transition through three phases, first a standard care phase, then a one month transition phase during which the training is delivered, and finally an intervention phase, for a total of 13 months. The implementation sequence determines how long the phases of standard care and intervention are. Patient participants will be followed up for a total of three months.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-justification"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Design justification</h2>
<p>We use the cluster randomised design because the intervention cannot be randomised at the individual patient level. We use the stepped-wedge design for two reasons. First, this design is statistically more efficient than the parallel cluster design when the number of clusters is limited<span class="citation" data-cites="Hemming2020May"><sup><a href="#ref-Hemming2020May" role="doc-biblioref">28</a></sup></span>. In this trial, the number of clusters is limited because of the costs associated with ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training and the available slots for ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training in India. Second, the stepped-wedge design is likely to enhance participation and engagement because all clusters receive the intervention. The batched stepped-wedge design further improves feasibility as it does not require all clusters to start at the same time, and it is robust to potential delays in cluster recruitment<span class="citation" data-cites="Kasza2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Kasza2022" role="doc-biblioref">29</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>The trial management group will compile a list of hospitals with potentially eligible clusters and reach out to them to assess their interest in participating in the trial. We will then screen hospitals for eligibility based on the criteria above, using a two-step procedure. First, we will approach hospitals to complete an initial hospital screening instrument (see Appendix <a href="#sec-appendix-hospital-screening-instrument">Section&nbsp;19.1</a>). We will then discuss each eligible hospital individually in the Trial Management Group before deciding whether to include it in the trial. We have this discussion because we strive to include hospitals that to a large extent conducts primary resuscitation of trauma patients, rather than hospitals that primarily receives transferred patients from other hospitals, but this is difficult to formalise in the eligibility criteria. We will then perform a more in-depth interview with selected hospitals (See Appendix <a href="#sec-appendix-hospital-screening-interview-instrument">Section&nbsp;19.2</a>). To avoid excluding centres we will also discuss plans to implement other potentially competing interventions during the trial period, and take these plans into account when assigning clusters to batches. For example, we are aware of the ongoing implementation of the National Emergency Life Support (NELS) programme in India, and will therefore not include hospitals that plan to implement this programme during the trial period. All screening steps and decisions will be logged using REDCap<span class="citation" data-cites="harris_research_2009 harris_redcap_2019"><sup><a href="#ref-harris_research_2009" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>,<a href="#ref-harris_redcap_2019" role="doc-biblioref">31</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>The intervention will be ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training. The control will be standard care, meaning no formal trauma life support training. We will train the physicians that initially resuscitate and provide trauma care during the first hour after patient arrival at the emergency department. These physicians can be casualty medical officers, surgical residents, or emergency medicine residents, depending on the setup at each participating centre. The training will occur during the transition phase in each cluster. Our experience from our pilot study is that study sites adhere to the training slot alloted to them through the trial, so we judge the risk of clusters implementing ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> before their randomised implementation sequence as very low.</p>
<p>We will train the number units of physicians needed to reach the required patient sample size, but estimate that this will require training an average of ten physicians per hospital, which on average should be mean that we can train one to two units per hospital. This is possible because many hospitals in India organise physicians staffing their emergency departments in units, and the physicians in the same unit work together in the emergency department on the same days of the week. We will therefore collect data only on the days when these units work. The units selected to constitute a cluster from each hospital will be a convenience sample out of all eligible units in those hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Trauma Life Support<sup>Â®</sup> (ATLS<sup>Â®</sup>)<span class="citation" data-cites="acsAtls2018"><sup><a href="#ref-acsAtls2018" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span></strong> is a proprietary 2.5 day course teaching a standardised approach to trauma patient care using the concepts of a primary and secondary survey. The programme was developed by the Committee of Trauma of the American College of Surgeons. The course includes intial treatment and resuscitation, triage and interfacility transfers. Leaning is based on practical scenario-driven skill stations, lectures and includes a final performance proficiency evaluation. Physicians will be trained in an accredited ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training facility in India.</p>
<p><strong>Standard care</strong> varies across hospitals in India, but trauma patients are initially managed by casualty medical officers, surgical residents, or emergency medicine residents. They are mainly first- or second-year residents who resuscitate patients, perform interventions and refer patients for imaging or other investigations. Compared with other settings where a trauma team approach is adopted, nurses and other healthcare professionals are only involved to a limited extent during the initial management.</p>

<p>These events are considered safety events because they suggest pulmonary, renal, septic or bleeding complications and an increase in their occurrence following ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training could indicate that the intervention is harmful.

<p>We will also report any other safety events that we identify during the trial, and the reporting of such will have to be based on the intuition of the clinical research coordinators and local investigators.

<p>All safety events will be recorded in the Case Record Form (CRF) and reported to the trial management team within 24 hours of its occurrence.

### Assessment of Adverse Events (AE)

#### **Assessment of causal relationship** 

*Text suggestion:* The investigator is responsible for determining
whether there is a causal relationship between the AE/SAE and use of the
investigational medicinal product.

Consideration should be given to whether there is a reasonable
possibility of establishing a causal relationship between the adverse
event and the investigational medicinal product based on the analysis of
the available evidence.

All AE can be categorized as either likely related, possibly related,
unlikely related or not related, in accordance with the definitions
below:

**Likely related**: Clinical event, including abnormal results from
laboratory analyses, occurring within a reasonable time after
administration of the intervention/investigational medicinal product. It
is unlikely that the event can be attributed to underlying disease or
other medications but is most likely caused by the investigational
medicinal product and its emergence is reasonable in relationship with
use of the investigational medicinal product.

**Possibly related**: Clinical event, including abnormal results from
laboratory analyses, occurring within a reasonable time after
administration of the intervention/investigational medicinal product.
The event could be explained by the investigational medicinal product
and its emergence is reasonable in relationship with use of the
investigational medicinal product, but there is insufficient information
to determine the relationship. The event could be explained by an
underlying disease or other medications.

**Unlikely related**: Clinical event, including abnormal responses from
laboratory tests, unlikely to be related to the
intervention/investigational medicinal product and can be reasonably
explained by other medication or underlying disease.

**Not related**: Clinical event, including abnormal results from
laboratory analyses, that is not reasonably related to the use of the
intervention/investigational medicinal product.

Those AEs which are suspected of having a causal relationship to the
investigational medicinal product will be followed up until the subject
has recovered or is well taken care of and on the way to good recovery
(see also section 9.4, Follow-up of Adverse Events).

If the reporting investigator does not provide any information on
causality, the sponsor should consult with the reporting investigator
and encourage the expression of a position on this issue. The sponsor
must take into account the assessment of causality provided by the
investigator. If the sponsor disagrees with the investigator\'s
assessment of causality, both the investigator\'s and the sponsor\'s
views should be included in the report.

#### **Assessment of intensity**

*In addition to assessing the causal relationship between administration
of the investigational medicinal product and AE, an assessment of the
intensity of the event is required. The following classifications can be
used:*

Each adverse event shall be classified by an investigator as mild,
moderate or severe.

**Mild:** The adverse event is relatively tolerable and transient in
nature but does not affect the subject's normal life.

**Moderate**: The adverse event causes deterioration of function but
does not affect health. The event can be sufficiently unpleasant and
interferes with normal activities but does not completely obstruct them.

**Severe**: The adverse event causes deterioration of function or work
ability or poses a health risk to the subject.

*Assessment of intensity is generally made by the reporting
investigator.*

*Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) is another way to
classify intensity according to a five-point scale.*

#### **Assessment of seriousness**

The investigator is responsible for assessing the seriousness (serious
or non-serious). If the adverse event is considered serious, this should
be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) by the investigator to the
sponsor. See also section 9.3.2, Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
(SAE).

### Reporting and registration of Adverse Events

-   *The investigator should register and document adverse event or
    abnormal laboratory responses identified in the protocol as critical
    for safety assessment and report them to the sponsor according to
    the reporting requirements and within the time periods specified in
    the protocol.*

-   *Less stringent rules from registration and reporting requirements
    may be granted in low-intervention clinical trials (for definition
    see cover page) after a thorough risk analysis.*

-   *The sponsor should maintain a detailed register of all adverse
    event reported by the investigator.*

-   *Describe how AE/SAE are captured, e.g., that trial subjects at each
    contact with the investigator/nurse will be asked about how they
    have been feeling since the previous visit or describe if another
    way is used to capture adverse event in the trial.*

-   *Describe where AE/SAE are registered. Normally, they are registered
    primarily in the subject's medical records. Describe how these will
    be registered in the trial's CRF, reporting forms or worksheets, and
    where registrations of severity and causality are made, since this
    is not always done in the medical record.*

-   *Also describe AEs which do not need to be documented and reported
    as AEs. If this is not indicated, all adverse medical events should
    be collected as AEs in, e.g., a diary or otherwise.*

-   *Describe here during which time period adverse events are intended
    to be followed, e.g., from trial start or from start of treatment
    with the investigational medicinal product to XX weeks after the
    last dose.*

-   *All reported adverse events that have not been resolved by the end
    of the trial should be followed up. How, when, and for how long this
    follow-up will last should be described, e.g., telephone contact or
    visit to the study site approximately XX weeks after the last visit
    in the trial. The follow-up and the time for the follow-up
    visit/contact are adapted to each individual trial.*

-   ***Assessment of causal relationship (between AE/SAE and
    investigational medicinal product), whether the AE is considered to
    be an SAE or not, shall be made by a licensed physician.***

*Text suggestion:* At each trial visit, adverse events (AE) are
registered, starting after *trial start/or from start of treatment with
the investigational medicinal product,* up to and including *X* *weeks*
after the subject has ended their treatment with the investigational
medicinal product. All AE that occurs during the trial and which are
observed by the investigator/trial nurse or reported by the subject will
be registered in the CRF regardless of whether they are related to the
investigational medicinal product or not. Assessment of causal
relationship, severity, and whether the AE is considered to be an SAE
will be made by the investigator directly in the *CRF/on a
trial-specific worksheet*. At minimum for each AE/SAE, a description of
the event is recorded (diagnosis/symptom if diagnosis is missing), start
and stop dates, causal relationship, severity, if the AE is considered
to be an SAE, measures and outcome.

The following symptoms are clearly related to the process and the
expected course of the condition and therefore will not be reported as
AE:

Example:

*Expected adverse events based on knowledge of the disease in question
and expected clinical course.*

#### **Reporting of Adverse Events (AE)**

*Text suggestion:* All AE shall be registered in the CRF within
*\<\<indicate time frame\>\> as indicated above (section 9.3, Reporting
and registration of Adverse Events)*.

#### **Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)**

*Text suggestion:* Serious adverse events (SAE) are reported to the
sponsor on a special SAE form within 24 hours of the investigator being
informed of the SAE.

Follow-up information describing the outcome and handling of the SAE is
reported as soon as this information is available. The original should
be kept in the Investigator Site File.

*Provide details about the reporting procedure for SAE. Include
reporting times, what will happen upon receipt of an SAE, who will
review what is reported and who will assess whether the adverse event
was expected for the investigational medicinal product or not (this is
done using the reference safety information). The processes for
receiving, confirming, and reviewing of reported SAEs should be
described. Reviewing of SAEs must occur in due time, with consideration
of the reporting times for a potential SUSAR.*

*Add information about SAEs that should not be reported.*

*Text suggestion:* Based on knowledge of the disease in question and
expected clinical course, some events that are otherwise serious are not
considered as SAEs in this trial. The following is a list of SAEs that
shall not be reported as SAEs:

**Example:**

1.  *Expected events based on the knowledge of the disease in question
    and expected clinical course.*

2.  *If a trial subject is hospitalized with a documented cancer-related
    problem, this will not be reported as an SAE.*

#### **Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR)**

*In investigator-initiated trials where non-commercial sponsors lack the
possibility to report SUSAR directly in the EudraVigilance database, the
Swedish Medical Products Agency can help with this when a SUSAR occurs
in Sweden. However, this must be clearly justified in the cover letter
to the application. Reporting then takes place via the [CIOMS
form](https://cioms.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cioms-form1.pdf) which
is sent to the Swedish Medical Products Agency via Eudralink. Since
these reports contain personal data, they should not be sent to the
Swedish Medical Products Agency via normal email.*

*The reference safety information provides the basis for assessing
whether the adverse reaction is unexpected or not.*

*SUSARs should, if possible, be reported unblinded, that is, should
state to which trial medicinal product the subject had a reaction. The
investigator should only unblind the treatment allocation for a subject
if unblinding is relevant to the subject\'s safety. Unblinded data
should only be available to persons who need to participate in safety
reporting to the regulatory authority and Data Safety Monitoring Boards
(DSMBs) or to persons performing ongoing safety evaluations during the
clinical trial. Placebo should only be reported if it is suspected that
any component of the placebo treatment has caused the reaction.*

*Text suggestion:* Those SAE which are assessed by sponsor to be SUSAR
are reported via a [CIOMS
form](https://cioms.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cioms-form1.pdf) to
the EudraVigilance database / Swedish Medical Products Agency according
to the specified time frames.

SUSAR that are fatal or life-threatening are reported as soon as
possible and no later than 7 days after the serious adverse event has
become known to the sponsor. Relevant follow-up information is sent
thereafter within an additional 8 days. Other SUSAR are reported as soon
as possible and no later than 15 days after they have come to the
sponsor's knowledge.

*Multicentre trials:* Information about SUSAR occurring during the trial
is compiled by the sponsor and sent to the principal investigators at
all participating sites. *In order to preserve the integrity of the
trial, it is recommended that reporting of SUSAR to investigators in a
blinded study is made without unblinding, that is, without specifying
which investigational medicinal product the subject received. Describe
how the reporting will be done.*

### Follow-up of Adverse Events

*Describe the follow-up of trial subjects who have been affected by
adverse events (AE/SAE) (until the adverse event is
resolved/stable/persistent) and measures in case of unacceptable adverse
events (dose adjustment, treatment interruption, withdrawal of subject
from the trial). Describe follow-up of subjects with regards to safety
after the trial is completed.*

<p>We will conduct all analysis by modified intention to treat. Clusters and observations within clusters will be considered exposed to the intervention after the date at which the cluster was scheduled to transition. All data will be included with the exception of the transition phases. We will not adjust for multiplicity of analyses because none of the secondary outcomes will be singularly more important. However, all secondary outcomes will be interpreted with due consideration for how all are affected by the intervention without putting any undue emphasis on a single outcome that might be statistically significant but where all others appear to have remained unchanged.</p>
<p>We will use a two-sided significance level of 5% and estimate 95% confidence intervals. The primary subgroup analyses will be based on geographical region because demonstrating the consistency of any effect across multiple regions will enhance the generalisibility of the results<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Additional subgroup analyses will include age across the groups older adolescents (15-19 years), young adults (20-24 years), adults (25-59 years), and older adults (60 years and older)<span class="citation" data-cites="Diaz2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Diaz2021" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span>; sex; and the clinical cohorts blunt multisytem trauma, penetrating trauma, and severe isolated traumatic brain injury.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.16.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-models"><span class="header-section-number">7.16.2</span> Analysis models</h3>
<p>There are a number of requirements for the analysis model. Firstly, all analysis will consider the clustered nature of the design. Secondly, as the trial has only 30 clusters, it will be essential that the model allows for a correction due to the small number of clusters. Thirdly, as the design is a stepped-wedge study, we will adjust for temporal confounding using categorical effects for period of the study (month). Full details on how each of these will be undertaken, with justification is provided below<span class="citation" data-cites="Li2020"><sup><a href="#ref-Li2020" role="doc-biblioref">34</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>For binary outcomes, a mixed effects binomial regression with a logit link will be used to estimate the odds ratio; and a binomial model with identity link used to estimate the risk difference. These models will be fitted using residual pseudo-likelihood estimation based on linearization with subject-specific expansion (RSPL). If the binomial model with the identity link does not converge then only a odds ratio will be reported.</p>
<p>We will include fixed effects for period and a fixed effect for intervention exposure. The primary analysis will allow for clustering by as a random cluster and random cluster by period effect. To correct the potential inflation of the type I error rate due to small number of clusters, the Kenward and Roger small sample correction will be used. In a sensitivity analysis we will explore if models with more complicated correlation structures are a better fit to the data. These models are not being used as our primary analysis models as there is limited understanding as to when such models will converge and how to choose between the various different correlation structures which might be plausible.</p>
<p>To this end we will additionally fit generalised linear mixed models (with same link functions and fixed effects as described above) to include a discrete time decay correlation structure including a random cluster effect with auto-regressive structure (AR(1)). To allow for the randomisation by batches, a different secular trend will be included for each batch (interaction between batch and period). For continuous, count and prevalence outcomes similar model-based approaches will be used but with appropriate links and distribution functions, using transformations where appropriate.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.16.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-sensitivity-analyses"><span class="header-section-number">7.16.3</span> Additional sensitivity analyses</h3>
<p>To additionally explore if the fixed period effect is both parsimonious and adequate to represent the extent of any underlying secular trend, we will model the time effect using a spline function. Models will also be extended to include random cluster by intervention effects (with a non-zero covariance term) to examine if results are sensitive to the assumption of no intervention by cluster interaction. Models will also be extended to include an interaction between treatment and number of periods since first treated, to examine if there is any indication of a relationship between duration of exposure to the intervention and outcomes.</p>
<p>This will allow us to different lag effects (whereby it takes time for the intervention to become embedded within the culture before its impact can properly start to be realised); as well as waning effects (whereby the effect of the intervention starts to decrease â or fade). This type of analysis attempts to disentangle how some clusters end up having a long exposure to the intervention and others have a much shorter exposure time. A fully adjusted covariate analysis will additionally adjust for a set of pre-specified individual-level covariates of known prognostic importance.</p>

<p>We will report time adjusted within-cluster correlations for all outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. We will report correlations from the different assumed correlation structures (so we will report intra-cluster correlations (ICC); within and between-period correlations; and within-period correlations and exponential decay). As well as reporting correlations we will additionally report all variance components. For all outcomes we will report correlations on the latent scale (i.e.&nbsp;proportions scale for binary outcomes) as is appropriate to inform future sample size calculations.</p>

<p>With 30 clusters and a total sample size of 4320 our study has ~90% power across different combinations of cluster autocorrelations (CAC) and intra-cluster correlations (ICC) to detect a reduction in the primary outcome from 20% under standard care to 15% after ATLS<sup>Â®</sup> training (see <a href="#fig-power-curves">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). This effect is a conservative estimate and the reduction equals a risk ratio of 0.75, which would be clinically important while also being consistent with our pilot study and updated systematic review. We allowed for the clustered design and assumed an ICC of 0.02, but considered sensitivity across the range 0.01-0.05<span class="citation" data-cites="Campbell2005 Eldridge2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Campbell2005" role="doc-biblioref">35</a>,<a href="#ref-Eldridge2015" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span>, and a CAC of 0.9 but considered sensitivity across the range 0.8-1.0, based on our pilot study and current guidance<span class="citation" data-cites="Hemming2020Feb Martin2016 Korevaar2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Hemming2020Feb" role="doc-biblioref">37</a>â<a href="#ref-Korevaar2021" role="doc-biblioref">39</a></sup></span>.

<p>In this trial, consent refers to consent for data collection. It is not possible for patients to opt out from being subjected to the intervention, as the intervention is delivered at the cluster level and involves training physicians in ATLS<sup>Â®</sup>, and these physicians cannot be expected to temporarily forget their training. Patient participants will be included in this trial under the following modes of consent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opt out consent for <strong>routinely collected data</strong>. Consent for collection of routinely recorded data by interview or extraction of information from medical records will be presumed unless actively declined. This approach is justified because the trial can be considered minimal risk and because data collection will be non-invasive. The patients or their legally authorized representative will be provided with written information about the study on their arrival at the hospital. The variables assumed to be routinely collected are listed in <a href="#sec-variables">Section&nbsp;13.2</a>.</li>
<li>Opt in consent and assent for <strong>non-routinely recorded data</strong>. Informed consent for non-routinely recorded data will be actively sought from patient participants or their legally authorized representative. For participants who are between 15 and 18 years of age we will obtain both the assent of the participant as well as the consent of their guardian or legally authorized representative. The clinical research coordinators will approach patient participants and their representatives after admission. The consent and assent will be written for patient participants who are admitted to the hospital and verbal for participants who are transferred or discharged before the clinical research coordinators have had an opportunity to approach them. The verbal consent will be audio recorded.</li>
<li>Waiver of informed consent for patients who are unconscious or otherwise unable to provide consent and do not have a legally authorized representative. This group represents the most severly injured patients and they have to be included to make the trial representative of the entire population of trauma patients. Patients participants who regain consciousness will be informed about the study and asked for consent for collection of non-routinely collected data.</li>

<!--
*From the protocol it must be clear how the data will be collected.
Describe which other types of data collection documents, in addition to
the CRF, are used, e.g.: diaries, quality of life questionnaires, health
economics, different patient-reported outcomes measures, etc. Describe
how corrections will occur and by whom, that there will be an
independent copy of the CRF with the investigator when the trial is
completed, and how other trial documentation is stored and who has
access to it. The sponsor and investigator must archive the information
in the Trial Master File for at least 25 years after the end of the
clinical trial, providing that a longer archiving period follows from
other parts of the law. The sponsor and investigator can also agree that
the documents shall be archived for a longer period. The Swedish
Archives Act (Arkivlagen) applies to archiving of research material. For
clinical trials in ATMP (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product), the
archiving period is 30 years according to GCP specific for ATMP.*

*The sponsor and the investigator shall keep a Clinical trial master
file with documentation for the whole trial. The clinical trial master
file shall at all times contain the essential documents relating to that
clinical trial which allow verification of the conduct of a clinical
trial and the quality of the data generated, taking into account all
characteristics of the clinical trial, including in particular whether
the clinical trial is a low-intervention clinical trial. It shall be
readily available, and directly accessible upon request, to the Member
States.*

*The clinical trial master file kept by the investigator and that kept
by the sponsor may have a different content if this is justified by the
different nature of the responsibilities of the investigator and the
sponsor. The principal investigator shall keep an Investigator Site File
(part of the Clinical Trial Master File) with all trial documentation
for the site. The files should have relevant content according to the
trial and follow ICH-GCP chapter 8 "Essential documents". The principal
investigator will store the trial site's data, subject identification
list, original of the subject information sheet and obtained trial
consent inaccessible to unauthorized persons, but such that trial
subjects can be identified by those responsible for the trial. This
information must not be stored at the sponsor.*

*For information about data protection see section 12.4, Data
protection.*

*Text suggestion:*

Subjects who participate in the trial are coded with a trial-specific
identification number. All subjects are registered in a subject
identification list (subject enrolment and identification list) that
connects the subject's name and personal number with a subject
number/trial identification number.

All data will be registered, managed, and stored in a manner that
enables correct reporting, interpretation, and verification. The
complete Trial Master File, as well as source documents, will be
archived for at least *25* years after the trial is completed. Source
data in the medical records system are stored and archived in accordance
with national regulations.

<p>This trial is not yet fully funded. The Trial Management Group has decided to proceed with the trial with the expectation that additional funding will be secured. The Trial Steering Committee will be informed of the funding status at each meeting. If funding is not secured, the trial will be stopped. This will likely result in an underpowered trial. The justification for this decision is that the intervention is considered standard of care in many countries and the data collection is considered minimal risk. There is therefore a very small risk of harm to patient participants, but a potential direct benefit to those patient participants who receive the intervention. The benefit-risk ratio is therefore considered to be favourable, even in the case of an underpowered trial.</p>

<p>There are ongoing discussions about re-framing the trial as a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial and include a cost-effectiveness analysis. This would involve adding additional data collection to assess the implementation and costs of the intervention. This would involve additional funding and amended ethical approvals.</p>

<!--
*The sponsor must notify, via CTIS, each concerned Member State that a
clinical trial involving that Member State has been terminated.
Notification must also be made when a trial has been terminated in all
participating EU countries and also when termination has occurred in all
participating third countries. The notification must be made within 15
days.*

*Within one year of the completion of the clinical trial in all Member
States, the sponsor must submit a summary of the results of the clinical
trial to CTIS, regardless of the outcome of the trial.*

*Guidance on content can be found in the CTR
([Link](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SV/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0536)),
Annex IV. It should be accompanied by a summary written in a way that is
understandable to lay people. The content of the summary is given in CTR
([Link](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SV/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0536)),
Annex V.*

*For clinical trials involving children, the above summaries must be
submitted within six months of the end of the trial. This shortened
deadline of six months applies to sponsors who are marketing
authorisation holders for the medicinal product.*

*If the trial is submitted for marketing authorization of an
investigational medicinal product, the applicant for marketing
authorisation must also, in addition to the summary of results, submit
the full clinical trial report to CTIS within 30 days of the decision
being taken.*

*In addition to submitting a summary of the results to CTIS a complete
report with individual data shall be available from the sponsor on
request or for any inspections by the Swedish Medical Products Agency
throughout the entire retention period. A published article is not to be
equated with a summary of a report. The report must contain sufficient
information so that the Swedish Medical Products Agency can make an
evaluation.*

*In addition to submitting a summary of the results to CTIS, a full
clinical trial report with individual data shall be completed by the
sponsor and provided to Principal investigators. The clinical trial
report shall be archived in the Trial Master File by the sponsor and by
the principal investigator at each site, in their Investigator Site
Files, throughout the entire retention period, and available on request
for inspections by the authorities. The clinical trial report must
contain sufficient information so that the Swedish Medical Products
Agency or other authorities can make a complete evaluation of the trial
conduct and the results. A published article is not to be equated with
the summary report to CTIS or the full clinical trial report.*

*The sponsor is responsible for the compilation of statistical analyses
and their presentation to involved principal investigators. These
analyses may be the basis for a manuscript for publication.*

*If the results are summarized in a manuscript with the purpose to
publish in a scientific journal, it is recommended that the EU trial
number is stated at the end of the abstract. This clearly documents that
the trial has been published in advance and meets the requirements from
ICMJE (International Committee for Medical Journal Editors) that are set
for publications in medical science journals.*

*If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely terminated due to a
change in the risk-benefit balance, for reasons of subject safety, this
must be notified to the Member States concerned through CTIS. The
notification should be made as soon as possible, but not later than 15
days after the clinical trial was suspended or terminated prematurely.
The reasons for such action and follow-up measures must be provided. The
resumption of a clinical trial after its temporary interruption due to a
change in the benefit/risk balance is considered a substantial
modification.*

*Interruptions that do not affect the benefit/risk relationship must be
notified, via CTIS, within 15 days, stating the reason for the
interruption. Notification of restart shall be made, via CTIS, within 15
days.See also section* *5.4,* *End of Trial, as well as section* *6.4,*
*Withdrawal criteria.*

*Text suggestion:*

End of the trial is reported in CTIS at the latest 15 days after
completion.

Within one year of trial completion, a clinical study report is
completed, and a summary of the clinical trial results must be reported
in CTIS, including a summary for lay people.
