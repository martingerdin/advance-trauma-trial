\section{Synopsis}\label{synopsis}}

\textbf{Title} Effects of Advanced Trauma Life
Support\textsuperscript{®} Training Compared to Standard Care on Adult
Trauma Patient Outcomes: A Cluster Randomised Trial

\textbf{Rationale} Trauma is a massive global health issue. Many
training programmes have been developed to help physicians in the
initial management of trauma patients. Among these programmes, Advanced
Trauma Life Support\textsuperscript{®} (ATLS\textsuperscript{®}) is the
most popular, having trained over one million physicians worldwide.
Despite its widespread use, there are no controlled trials showing that
ATLS\textsuperscript{®} improves patient outcomes. Multiple systematic
reviews emphasise the need for such trials.

\textbf{Aim} To compare the effects of ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training
with standard care on outcomes in adult trauma patients.

\textbf{Primary Outcome} In-hospital mortality within 30 days of arrival
at the emergency department.

\textbf{Trial Design} Batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial in
India.

\textbf{Trial Population} Adult trauma patients presenting to the
emergency department of a participating hospital.

\textbf{Sample Size} 30 clusters and 4320 patients.

\textbf{Eligibility Criteria}

\emph{Hospitals} are secondary or tertiary hospitals in India that admit
or refer/transfer for admission at least 400 patients with trauma per
year.

\emph{Clusters} are one or more units of physicians providing initial
trauma care in the emergency department of tertiary hospitals in India.

\emph{Patients participants} are adult trauma patients who presents to
the emergency department of participating hospitals and are admitted or
transferred for admission.

\textbf{Intervention} The intervention will be ATLS\textsuperscript{®}
training, a proprietary 2.5 day course teaching a standardised approach
to trauma patient care using the concepts of a primary and secondary
survey. Physicians will be trained in an accredited
ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training facility in India.

\textbf{Ethical Considerations} We will use an opt-out consent approach
for collection of routinely recorded data. We will obtain informed
consent for collection of non-routinely recorded data, such as quality
of life and disability outcomes. Patients who are unconscious or lack a
legally authorized representative will be included under a waiver of
informed consent. Note that consent here refers to consent to data
collection.

\textbf{Trial Period} November 2024, to October 2029

\hypertarget{background-and-rationale}{%
\section{Background and rationale}\label{background-and-rationale}}

Each year, 4.3 million people die from trauma\textsuperscript{1}. Among
people aged 10-24 and 25-49 years trauma is the largest cause of
disability adjusted life years\textsuperscript{2}. Most deaths from
trauma occur within the first 24-48 hours\textsuperscript{3}. Traumatic
brain injury and exsanguination are the most common causes of trauma
deaths\textsuperscript{4,5}. Most preventable trauma deaths are caused
by clinical judgement errors during initial resuscitation or early care
including airway management and haemorrhage control, even though the
deaths occur later during the hospital stay\textsuperscript{4,6}.

Several trauma life support training programmes have been developed to
improve the early management of patients in the hospital by providing a
structured framework for assessment and
treatment\textsuperscript{7--11}. The proprietary Advanced Trauma Life
Support\textsuperscript{®} (ATLS\textsuperscript{®}) is the most
established trauma life support training programme and more than one
million physicians in over 80 countries have been trained in the
programme since the first course in 1978\textsuperscript{12}. In the US
and many other countries training in ATLS\textsuperscript{®} is
virtually mandatory for trauma care physicians\textsuperscript{13}.
Uptake in low- and middle income countries (LMIC) has been slow,
potentially due to high costs\textsuperscript{9}.

There are three randomised studies showing that ATLS\textsuperscript{®}
improves knowledge and clinical skills\textsuperscript{14--16}, but
there are no randomised controlled trials or high-quality
quasi-experimental trials indicating that ATLS\textsuperscript{®}
improves patient outcomes\textsuperscript{7,8,10,11,17}. We conducted an
updated systematic review (unpublished), and estimated a pooled risk
ratio of 0.82 (95\% CI 0.60; 1.11) from ten heterogeneous
(I\textsuperscript{2} 0.91) observational studies on the effect of ATLS
on mortality (see Figure~\ref{fig-forest-plot})\textsuperscript{18--27}.

We conducted a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05417243) between April 2022 and February 2023 as
part of our network grant to assess the feasibility of a full scale
trial. We published the protocol for this pilot
study\textsuperscript{28}. Our pilot study enrolled 376 patients from
seven hospitals across India (unpublished data) and shows that it is
feasible to conduct the proposed trial with a high percentage of
patients consenting to out of hospital follow up (78\%), low loss to
follow-up rate (1\%), and low missingness in key variables (mean 0.8\%).

To involve patients and the public in the planning of this trial we
conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with trauma patients,
caregivers, and community representatives (unpublished data). The aim of
these interviews was to understand their views on the trial and
important outcomes and the interviews showed high acceptability of our
research and emphasised the importance of better recovery before
discharge and functional outcomes at and after discharge, including
pain, mobility and self-care activities. The interviews also highlighted
return to work as an important outcome.

\hypertarget{updated-systematic-review}{%
\subsection{Updated systematic review}\label{updated-systematic-review}}

We performed a systematic literature search in the Medline, Embase,
Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases (PROSPERO
ID CRD42022373977). The last search was conducted on November 11, 2022.
We developed the search strategy in Medline (Ovid) in collaboration with
librarians at the Karolinska Institutet University Library. We limited
the search to English language articles, searched all databases from
inception, and screened a total of 7896 records. We used a random
effects model to pool estimates across studies.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{benefit-risk-evaluation}{%
\section{Benefit-risk evaluation}\label{benefit-risk-evaluation}}

The direct risks includes integrity violations and data leakage. We will
mitigate these risks by employing rigorous data collection and storage
mechanisms. The procedures that we will use to collect data will be
direct observation of care, routine physical examinations,
questionnaires, and extraction of already collected data from patient
records, which are often seen as involving only minimal risk.

The long-term risks of the research and the risk that the research will
be used in detrimental ways are minimal. Our trial will assess the
effect of Advanced Trauma Life Support\textsuperscript{®}
(ATLS\textsuperscript{®}) on patient outcomes. Training in
ATLS\textsuperscript{®} is standard in many health care systems and it
is unlikely that training physicians in this programme induces any harm
to participants.

We consider these risks weighed up by the potential direct benefit for
the participants in the intervention phase, if ATLS\textsuperscript{®}
is found to improve patient outcomes, and by the potential for improved
care for the trauma patient population.

\hypertarget{regulatory-approvals-and-trial-registration}{%
\section{Regulatory approvals and trial
registration}\label{regulatory-approvals-and-trial-registration}}

We will submit this trial to the Health Ministry Screening Committee at
the Indian Council for Medical Research for their approval. We will
apply for ethical approvals from each participating hospital, The George
Institute for Global Health in India and the Swedish Ethical Review
Authority. We will register this trial with Clinical Trials
Registry-India and ClinicalTrials.gov.

\hypertarget{trial-design-and-procedures}{%
\section{Trial design and
procedures}\label{trial-design-and-procedures}}

\hypertarget{overall-trial-design}{%
\subsection{Overall trial design}\label{overall-trial-design}}

We will conduct a batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled
trial (see Figure~\ref{fig-trial-design}). The stepped-wedge trial is a
uni-directional cross-over trial but the time point when clusters
cross-over from standard care to the intervention is
randomised\textsuperscript{29}. Each cluster will be at least one unit
of physicians performing initial resuscitation of trauma patients in the
emergency department of tertiary hospitals in India. The number of units
that we will train in each hospital will depend on the sizes of these
units and the volumes of patients that they see. If more than one unit
is trained in the same hospital these units will be considered one unit
for the purpose of randomisation. We choose this approach for two
reasons: 1) it will not be logistically or financially feasible to train
all physician in a given hospital; and 2) we need to balance cluster
size with the number of clusters. We will conduct this trial in India
because physicians providing initial trauma care in India are so far not
routinely trained in ATLS\textsuperscript{®} or similar programmes.

We will roll out the interventions to 30 clusters over six batches, so
there will be five clusters in each batch. The clusters in each batch
will be randomised to one of five implementation sequences, with one
hospital randomised to each implementation sequence. All clusters will
transition through three phases, first a standard care phase, then a one
month transition phase during which the training is delivered, and
finally an intervention phase, for a total of 13 months. The
implementation sequence determines how long the phases of standard care
and intervention are. Patient participants will be followed up for a
total of three months.

\hypertarget{design-justification}{%
\subsection{Design justification}\label{design-justification}}

We use the cluster randomised design because the intervention cannot be
randomised at the individual patient level. We use the stepped-wedge
design for two reasons. First, this design is statistically more
efficient than the parallel cluster design when the number of clusters
is limited\textsuperscript{30}. In this trial, the number of clusters is
limited because of the costs associated with ATLS\textsuperscript{®}
training and the available slots for ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training in
India. Second, the stepped-wedge design is likely to enhance
participation and engagement because all clusters receive the
intervention. The batched stepped-wedge design further improves
feasibility as it does not require all clusters to start at the same
time, and it is robust to potential delays in cluster
recruitment\textsuperscript{31}.

\hypertarget{eligibility-criteria}{%
\subsection{Eligibility criteria}\label{eligibility-criteria}}

Our trial include eligibility criteria on three levels: hospitals,
clusters and patient participants. We include eligibility on both the
hospital and cluster level to facilitate the screening process.

\hypertarget{hospital-selection}{%
\subsection{Hospital selection}\label{hospital-selection}}

Hospitals will be secondary or tertiary hospitals providing trauma care
in India. Hospital will be the unit of randomisation.

\hypertarget{inclusions-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Inclusions criteria}\label{inclusions-criteria}}

\textbf{Hospitals} must meet the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  admit or refer/transfer for admission at least 400 patients with
  trauma per year or 35 patients with trauma per month for at least the
  last six months;
\item
  provide surgical and orthopaedic emergency services around the clock;
  and
\item
  have at most 25\% of physicians providing initial trauma care trained
  in a formalised trauma life support training programme, like
  ATLS\textsuperscript{®} or Primary Trauma Care (PTC).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exclusion-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Exclusion criteria}\label{exclusion-criteria}}

\textbf{Hospitals} are excluded if they meet any of the following
criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the hospital of the cluster implements a formalised trauma life
  support training programme \footnote{These include but are not limited
    to the National Emergency Life Support (NELS) programme, the Basic
    Trauma Life Support (BTLS) programme, the Pre-Hospital Trauma Life
    Support (PHTLS) programme, the Trauma Nursing Core Course (TNCC) and
    the Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses (ATCN) programme.} during the
  trial period; or
\item
  the hospital of the cluster plan to implement or implements other
  major interventions\footnote{These include but are not limited to
    implementing of a trauma team approach, opening a trauma centre and
    implementing a trauma quality improvement programme.} that affects
  trauma care during the trial period.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{screening}{%
\subsubsection{Screening}\label{screening}}

The trial management group will compile a list of hospitals with
potentially eligible clusters and reach out to them to assess their
interest in participating in the trial. We will then screen hospitals
for eligibility based on the criteria above, using a two-step procedure.
First, we will approach hospitals to complete an initial hospital
screening instrument (see Appendix
Section~\ref{sec-appendix-hospital-screening-instrument}). We will then
discuss each eligible hospital individually in the Trial Management
Group before deciding whether to include it in the trial. We have this
discussion because we strive to include hospitals that to a large extent
conducts primary resuscitation of trauma patients, rather than hospitals
that primarily receives transferred patients from other hospitals, but
this is difficult to formalise in the eligibility criteria. We will then
perform a more in-depth interview with selected hospitals (See Appendix
Section~\ref{sec-appendix-hospital-screening-interview-instrument}). To
avoid excluding centres we will also discuss plans to implement other
potentially competing interventions during the trial period, and take
these plans into account when assigning clusters to batches. For
example, we are aware of the ongoing implementation of the National
Emergency Life Support (NELS) programme in India, and will therefore not
include hospitals that plan to implement this programme during the trial
period. All screening steps and decisions will be logged using
REDCap\textsuperscript{32,33}.

\hypertarget{cluster-selection}{%
\subsection{Cluster selection}\label{cluster-selection}}

Clusters are one or more units of physicians providing initial trauma
care in the emergency department of secondary or tertiary hospitals in
India. These units already exist in the hospitals and rotate through the
emergency department on specific days of the week.

\hypertarget{inclusion-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Inclusion criteria}\label{inclusion-criteria}}

\textbf{Clusters} must meet the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  admits or refers/transfers for admission at least 12 patients with
  trauma per month for at least the last six months; and
\item
  no more than 25\% of physicians providing initial trauma care trained
  in a formalised trauma life support training programme.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{screening-1}{%

Patient participants are adult trauma patients who presents to the
emergency department of participating hospitals and are admitted or
transferred for admission.

\hypertarget{inclusion-criteria-1}{%

\textbf{Patients participants} must meet the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  age of at least 15 years;
\item
  trauma occurred less than 48 hours before arrival at the hospital;
\item

  history of trauma defined as having any of the reasons listed in the
  International Classification of Diseases chapter XX as the reason for
  presenting;
\item
  admitted, or died between arrival at the hospital and admission, or
  referred/transferred from the emergency department of a participating
  hospital to another hospital for admission; and
\item
  managed by a participating cluster in the emergency department.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exclusion-criteria-1}{%
\subsubsection{Exclusion criteria}\label{exclusion-criteria-1}}

\textbf{Patients participants} are excluded if they meet the following
criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  present with isolated limb injuries; or
\item
  are directly admitted to a ward without being seen by a physician in
  the emergency department.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{screening-2}{%
\subsubsection{Screening}\label{screening-2}}

Clinical research coordinators will screen patient participants either
as they arrive to the emergency department or using emergency department
registers. The patients or their representatives will receive written
information about the study before they are discharged, including about
their right to opt out at any time before final analysis. Phone numbers
for out of hospital follow up will be extracted from the emergency
department registers, and will be securely held only by the clinical
research coordinators at each sites.

\hypertarget{withdrawal-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Withdrawal criteria}\label{withdrawal-criteria}}

Patient participants can choose to withdraw their consent for collection
of non-routinely recorded data at any time before the final analysis. If
they withdraw their consent for this data collection the clinical
research coordinator will not collect any more of this data, which also
means that no further follow-ups will be conducted. They can also choose
to have the data already collected about them removed from the trial at
any time before final analysis of the data. Withdrawal of consent or
removal of data from the trial will not affect their care in any way. If
the patient participant withdraws consent, follow-up of this participant
will be performed according to the participating hospitals routine.

\hypertarget{procedures}{%
\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures}}

Table~\ref{tbl-procedures} shows an overview of trial procedures.
Clinical research coordinators will follow up patients daily until
discharge to capture injury information. They will also follow up
patients at 24 hours, 30 days and 90 days after arrival to the emergency
department to capture mortality outcomes, and at 30 days and 90 days
after arrival to the emergency department to capture functional outcomes
and return to work. If patient participants are discharged before any of
these follow-up time points, clinical research coordinators will follow
up patients by phone.

This trial does not include biological sampling.

\hypertarget{end-of-trial}{%
\subsection{End of trial}\label{end-of-trial}}

The trial ends when the last patient participant has completed the last
follow-up. The trial may be prematurely terminated if it this is
necessary for safety reasons affecting the risk-benefit balance or if
the recruitment of subjects cannot be met within reasonable time limits.
If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the investigator
should immediately inform the subjects about this and ensure appropriate
treatment and follow-up. Decisions on premature termination are taken by
the joint Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committee and Trial
Management Group.

\hypertarget{intervention-and-control-treatment}{%
\subsection{Intervention and control
treatment}\label{intervention-and-control-treatment}}

The intervention will be ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training. The control
will be standard care, meaning no formal trauma life support training.
We will train the physicians that initially resuscitate and provide
trauma care during the first hour after patient arrival at the emergency
department. These physicians can be casualty medical officers, surgical
residents, or emergency medicine residents, depending on the setup at
each participating centre. The training will occur during the transition
phase in each cluster. Our experience from our pilot study is that study
sites adhere to the training slot alloted to them through the trial, so
we judge the risk of clusters implementing ATLS\textsuperscript{®}
before their randomised implementation sequence as very low.

We will train the number units of physicians needed to reach the
required patient sample size, but estimate that this will require
training an average of ten physicians per hospital, which on average
should be mean that we can train one to two units per hospital. This is
possible because many hospitals in India organise physicians staffing
their emergency departments in units, and the physicians in the same
unit work together in the emergency department on the same days of the
week. We will therefore collect data only on the days when these units
work. The units selected to constitute a cluster from each hospital will
be a convenience sample out of all eligible units in those hospitals.

\textbf{Advanced Trauma Life Support\textsuperscript{®}
(ATLS\textsuperscript{®})\textsuperscript{12}} is a proprietary 2.5 day
course teaching a standardised approach to trauma patient care using the
concepts of a primary and secondary survey. The programme was developed
by the Committee of Trauma of the American College of Surgeons. The
course includes intial treatment and resuscitation, triage and
interfacility transfers. Leaning is based on practical scenario-driven
skill stations, lectures and includes a final performance proficiency
evaluation. Physicians will be trained in an accredited
ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training facility in India. We will assess
adherence to ATLS principles before and after implementing ATLS
training.

\textbf{Standard care} varies across hospitals in India, but trauma
patients are initially managed by casualty medical officers, surgical
residents, or emergency medicine residents. They are mainly first- or
second-year residents who resuscitate patients, perform interventions
and refer patients for imaging or other investigations. Compared with
other settings where a trauma team approach is adopted, nurses and other
healthcare professionals are only involved to a limited extent during
the initial management.

the investigators and will not be considered an exclusion criterion.

\hypertarget{randomisation}{%
\subsection{Randomisation}\label{randomisation}}

We will assign clusters to batches as they are found to be eligible and
receive ethical approval. Batches will include clusters from hospitals
in different regions to optimize trial logistics. We will randomise the
clusters alloted to each batch to the different intervention
implementation sequences within that batch\footnote{Randomisation will
  be done using bespoke code from previous trials.}. We will balance the
randomisation within each batch on cluster size, defined as monthly
volume of eligible patient participants, using covariate constrained
randomisation. The cluster sizes are expected to vary between 12 and 20
patients per month, based on our previous experiences. We will conceal
the randomisation order for as long as it is logistically possible,
considering that arrangements for sending physicians to
ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training need to be made in advance.

The primary outcome will be in-hospital mortality within 30 days of
arrival at the emergency department. Clinical research coordinators will
extract information on death from patient hospital records. If the
patient has been transferred to another hospital, the clinical research
coordinators will collect data on this outcome by calling the patient or
a patient representative, or by contacting the hospital to which the
patient was transferred. Data on this outcome will be collected
continuously during the trial.

\item
  Length of emergency department stay. Data on this outcome will be
  collected from patient hospital records.
\item
  Length of hospital stay. Data on this outcome will be collected from
  patient hospital records.
\item
  Intensive care unit admission. Data on this outcome will be collected

\item
  Length of intensive care unit stay. Data on this outcome will be
  collected from patient hospital records.
\item
  Adherence to ATLS\textsuperscript{®} principles during initial patient
  resuscitation, up to one hour after the physician has first seen the
  patient. This assessment will be done using a 14 item checklist
  covering the key steps of the ATLS\textsuperscript{®} primary
  survey,which was modelled based on previous work on
  ATLS\textsuperscript{®} adherence\textsuperscript{34}. We will
  consider completion of all 14 steps as 100\% adherence. We will
  collect this data by observing the care of a random sample of
  patients. The sampling will be designed as a nested staircase design.
  The clinical research coordinators collecting the data will be trained
  by participating in an ATLS\textsuperscript{®} course as observers,
  prior to the start of the trial.
\item
  Quality of life within seven days of discharge, and at 30 days and
  three months of arrival at the emergency department, measured by the
  official and validated translations of the EQ5D3L. Data on this
  outcome will be collected in person if the patient is still in
  hospital, or by phone if the patient has been discharged. We will
  collect this data using a nested staircase design.
\item
  Disability within seven days of discharge, and at 30 days and three
  months of arrival at the emergency department, assessed using the WHO
  Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). Data on this outcome
  will be collected in person if the patient is still in hospital, or by
  phone if the patient has been discharged. This data will also be
  collected using a nested staircase design.
\item
  Return to work at 30 days and three months after arrival at the

Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject and, which

in the trial, whether or not related to the trial.

\subsubsection{Reporting and assessment of adverse and safety
events}\label{reporting-and-assessment-of-adverse-and-safety-events}}

In alignment with other current trials including critically ill
patients\textsuperscript{35}, we will not collect adverse events or
serious adverse events, because many of these events are expected in
this patient population and we already collect many of these events, for
example mortality, as part of our outcomes.

We will only report safety events, if they are life-threatening, prolong
hospitalisation or result in meaningful harm to the participant. We
cannot pre-define a comprehensive list of events that can be considered
safety events, but will actively assess the presence of the following
safety events:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Prolonged mechanical ventilation (\textgreater{} 7 days)
\item
  Initiation of renal replacement therapy
\item
  Prolonged (\textgreater{} 2 days) or renewed (restart after at least 2
  days without) use of vasopressors such as norepinephrine or
  vasopressin
\end{itemize}

These events are considered safety events because they suggest
pulmonary, renal, septic or bleeding complications and an increase in
their occurrence following ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training could
indicate that the intervention is harmful. These events therefore need
to be tracked during the standard care phase as well as the intervention
phase, but will only be considered indicative of harm related to the
intervention if they occur more often during the intervention phase than
during the standard care phase.

We will also report any other safety events that we identify during the
trial, and the reporting of such will have to be based on the intuition
of the clinical research coordinators and local investigators. Examples
of such safety events could include missed injuries or missed
investigations, which could be suspected if certain injuries or
investigations were identified or conducted more often during the
standard care phase than during the intervention phase.

All safety events will be recorded in the Case Record Form (CRF) and
reported to the trial management team within 24 hours of its occurrence.
The trial management team will then assess if the event can be
considered related to the trial or the intervention within 24 hours of
it being reported. Events that are considered probably related will be
reported immediately to the joint Trial Steering and Data Monitoring
Committee.

\hypertarget{follow-up-of-safety-events}{%

\hypertarget{general-principles}{%
\subsubsection{General principles}\label{general-principles}}

We will conduct all analysis by modified intention to treat. Clusters
and observations within clusters will be considered exposed to the
intervention after the date at which the cluster was scheduled to
transition. All data will be included with the exception of the
transition phases. We will not adjust for multiplicity of analyses
because none of the secondary outcomes will be singularly more
important. However, all secondary outcomes will be interpreted with due
consideration for how all are affected by the intervention without
putting any undue emphasis on a single outcome that might be
statistically significant but where all others appear to have remained
unchanged.

We will use a two-sided significance level of 5\% and estimate 95\%
confidence intervals. The primary subgroup analyses will be based on
geographical region because demonstrating the consistency of any effect
across multiple regions will enhance the generalisibility of the
results\footnote{\textbf{Note:} Batches will not be based on regions
  because it will be logistically more feasible to include clusters from
  different regions in each batch.}. Additional subgroup analyses will
include age across the groups older adolescents (15-19 years), young
adults (20-24 years), adults (25-59 years), and older adults (60 years
and older)\textsuperscript{36}; sex; and the clinical cohorts blunt
multisytem trauma, penetrating trauma, and severe isolated traumatic
brain injury.

\hypertarget{analysis-models}{%
\subsubsection{Analysis models}\label{analysis-models}}

There are a number of requirements for the analysis model. Firstly, all
analysis will consider the clustered nature of the design. Secondly, as
the trial has only 30 clusters, it will be essential that the model
allows for a correction due to the small number of clusters. Thirdly, as
the design is a stepped-wedge study, we will adjust for temporal
confounding using categorical effects for period of the study (month).
Full details on how each of these will be undertaken, with justification
is provided below\textsuperscript{37}.

For binary outcomes, a mixed effects binomial regression with a logit
link will be used to estimate the odds ratio; and a binomial model with
identity link used to estimate the risk difference. These models will be
fitted using residual pseudo-likelihood estimation based on
linearization with subject-specific expansion (RSPL). If the binomial
model with the identity link does not converge then only a odds ratio
will be reported.

We will include fixed effects for period and a fixed effect for
intervention exposure. The primary analysis will allow for clustering by
as a random cluster and random cluster by period effect. To correct the
potential inflation of the type I error rate due to small number of
clusters, a correction for a small number of clusters will be applied,
but the correction that will be selected will be based on the best
available evidence available closer to the time, and it may differ for
the outcomes collected via the complete and incomplete designs. In a
sensitivity analysis we will explore if models with more complicated
correlation structures are a better fit to the data. These models are
not being used as our primary analysis models as there is limited
understanding as to when such models will converge and how to choose
between the various different correlation structures which might be
plausible.

To this end we will additionally fit generalised linear mixed models
(with same link functions and fixed effects as described above) to
include a discrete time decay correlation structure including a random
cluster effect with auto-regressive structure (AR(1)). To allow for the
randomisation by batches, a different secular trend will be included for
each batch (interaction between batch and period). For continuous, count
and prevalence outcomes similar model-based approaches will be used but
with appropriate links and distribution functions, using transformations
where appropriate.

and adequate to represent the extent of any underlying secular trend, we
will model the time effect using a spline function. Models will also be
extended to include random cluster by intervention effects (with a
non-zero covariance term) to examine if results are sensitive to the
assumption of no intervention by cluster interaction. Models will also
be extended to include an interaction between treatment and number of
periods since first treated, to examine if there is any indication of a
relationship between duration of exposure to the intervention and
outcomes.

This will allow us to different lag effects (whereby it takes time for
the intervention to become embedded within the culture before its impact
can properly start to be realised); as well as weaning effects (whereby
the effect of the intervention starts to decrease -- or fade). This type
of analysis attempts to disentangle how some clusters end up having a
long exposure to the intervention and others have a much shorter
exposure time. A fully adjusted covariate analysis will additionally
adjust for a set of pre-specified individual-level covariates of known
prognostic importance.

\hypertarget{estimation-and-reporting-of-within-cluster-correlations}{%
\subsubsection{Estimation and reporting of within cluster
correlations}\label{estimation-and-reporting-of-within-cluster-correlations}}

We will report time adjusted within-cluster correlations for all
outcomes with 95\% confidence intervals. We will report correlations
from the different assumed correlation structures (so we will report
intra-cluster correlations (ICC); within and between-period
correlations; and within-period correlations and exponential decay). As
well as reporting correlations we will additionally report all variance
components. For all outcomes we will report correlations on the latent
scale (i.e.~proportions scale for binary outcomes) as is appropriate to
inform future sample size calculations.

\hypertarget{sample-size-calculations}{%
\subsubsection{Sample size
calculations}\label{sample-size-calculations}}

With 30 clusters across 6 batches and a total sample size of 4320 our
study has \textasciitilde90\% power across different combinations of
cluster autocorrelations (CAC) and intra-cluster correlations (ICC) to
detect a reduction in the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality
within 30 days from 20\% under standard care to 15\% after
ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training (see Figure~\ref{fig-power-curves}).
This effect is a conservative estimate and the reduction equals a risk
ratio of 0.75, which would be clinically important while also being
consistent with our pilot study and updated systematic review. We
allowed for the clustered design and assumed an ICC of 0.02, but
considered sensitivity across the range
0.01-0.05\textsuperscript{38,39}, and a CAC of 0.9 but considered
sensitivity across the range 0.8-1.0, based on our pilot study and
current guidance\textsuperscript{40--42}. We included the CAC to allow
for variation in clustering over time. We assume that each cluster will
contribute approximately 12 observations per month to the analysis,
based on our previous work.

\textbf{A)} Shows power curves assuming a reduction in the primary
outcome of in-hospital mortality within 30 days from 20\% under standard

power curves assuming a reduction in the primary outcome from 10\% under
standard care to 7.5\% after ATLS\textsuperscript{®} training. Under
this scenario, we would need to increase the sample size per month to
around 30 observations to achieve 90\% powere under most combinations of
CAC and ICC.}

\hypertarget{interim-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Interim analysis}\label{interim-analysis}}

There will be one interim analyses after half of the batches have
completed the trial. The interim analyses will be assessed by the joint
Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committee. The purposes of this
interim analysis will be to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  assess the trial's feasibility and recommend stopping the trial if the
  trial is not feasible, for example if hospitals fail to adhere to the
  randomisation schedule or if there are substantial missing data in
  outcomes;
\item
  compare characteristics across intervention conditions to monitor for
  differential recruitment/ascertainment between intervention and
  control.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{quality-control-and-quality-assurance}{%
\subsection{Quality control and quality
assurance}\label{quality-control-and-quality-assurance}}

The George Institute for Global Health - India will ensure proper
conduct of the trial through quality control measures including on-site
training of personnel, standard operating procedures, ongoing quality
metrics assessment, review of missing data and outliers, and
round-the-clock availability of coordinating center personnel and
Principal Investigators. The trial will strictly follow ICH GCP
principles, Indian regulations, and George Institute procedures. The
trial operations staff from the George Institute India will train local
investigators, and trial site staff, before the trial, with continuous
documentation in the site master file. All documentation will be stored
securely and retained according to regulatory requirements.

\hypertarget{quality-assurance-and-oversight}{%
\subsection{Quality assurance and
oversight}\label{quality-assurance-and-oversight}}

The Trial Management Group and Trial Team, comprising key project
leaders and managers, will play a pivotal role in ensuring the highest
standards of quality assurance and effective sponsor oversight
throughout the trial. These groups will be responsible for facilitating
consistent communication, maintaining fidelity in study implementation,
and overseeing the quality of data collection.

To achieve these objectives, the groups will implement a comprehensive
communication plan and provide extensive training to site personnel. The
training will cover not only the study protocol but also practical
aspects of various systems, supplemented by both written and electronic
materials designed to educate study and clinical emergency staff.

The trial's quality assurance systems will be meticulously designed
based on a thorough risk analysis. A key component of our quality
assurance strategy will include the development and implementation of
detailed operational manuals and regular meetings. These tools and
interactions will ensure that all trial personnel will be used to uphold
the trial's quality standards.

Central to our oversight approach will be a comprehensive monitoring and
auditing plan. This plan will be tailored based on the identified risks
associated with the trial. Through these comprehensive measures, the
trial management group, in conjunction with the hospital staff, will
ensure that the trial is conducted with the utmost rigor, adhering to
the highest standards of quality assurance and effective sponsor
oversight.

\hypertarget{monitoring}{%
\subsection{Monitoring}\label{monitoring}}

We will implement a multi-tiered monitoring strategy, including
centralized data consistency checks, statistical monitoring, and
selective on-site evaluations. Key integrity measures include source
data verification, data entry validation, and regular audits. Any
protocol deviations will be thoroughly documented, with serious breaches
promptly addressed to ensure data integrity. Monitors from coordinating
centres will assist investigators in maintaining high ethical,
scientific, technical, and regulatory quality. Monitoring visits will
review protocol adherence, participant recruitment, adverse event
reporting, compliance with study procedures, and regulatory adherence.
Regular remote monitoring of the web-based database will be conducted to
ensure data integrity, using validation and consistency rules and
regular data cleaning. The Trial Team and Trial Management Group will
monitor baseline characteristics, opt-in consent rates and differential
opt-in consent rates across trial arms, follow-up rates, CRF return and
completeness rates, and safety data.

\hypertarget{deviations-serious-breaches-and-other-reporting-obligations}{%

obligations}\label{deviations-serious-breaches-and-other-reporting-obligations}}

The responsible investigator shall, without delay, report to the sponsor
any serious breaches and deviations from the trial protocol, ICH-GCP and
other regulations that significantly and directly affect, or with high
likelihood could affect, the subjects' safety and integrity or the
reliability and robustness of the data generated in the trial. The
sponsor should assess the suspected serious breach and the consequences
of deviations that have occurred. Minor deviations that do not affect
subjects' integrity or safety, nor significantly affect the trial's
scientific value, are documented in the trial documentation of the
principal investigator and the sponsor and appropriate measures shall be
taken. The deviations must be recorded in the clinical trial report.

\hypertarget{audits-and-inspections}{%
\section{Audits and inspections}\label{audits-and-inspections}}

Authorized representatives for the sponsor and Competent Authorities
(CA) may carry out audits or inspections at the trial site, including
source data verification. The investigator must ensure that all source
documents are available for audits and inspections. The purpose of an
audit or inspection is to systematically and independently review all
trial-related activities and documents, to determine whether these
activities were performed, registered, analyzed and reported correctly
according to protocol, ICH- GCP and applicable regulations.

\hypertarget{procedure-for-obtaining-consent}{%
\subsection{Procedure for obtaining
consent}\label{procedure-for-obtaining-consent}}

In this trial, consent refers to data collection, as patients cannot opt
out of the intervention. This is because the intervention is implemented
at the cluster level, involving training physicians in
ATLS\textsuperscript{®}. It is unreasonable to expect these physicians
to temporarily disregard their training. Patient participants will be
included in this trial under the following modes of consent:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Opt out consent for \textbf{routinely recorded data and measurement of
  adherence to ATLS\textsuperscript{®} principles}. Consent for the
  collection of routinely recorded data, either through interviews or by
  extracting information from medical records, as well as for the
  measurement of adherence to ATLS\textsuperscript{®} principles, will
  be presumed unless explicitly declined. This approach is justified
  because the trial is considered to pose minimal risk and because data
  collection will be non-invasive. Additionally, obtaining consent
  specifically for the measurement of adherence to
  ATLS\textsuperscript{®} principles could interfere with the provision
  of care and cause undue stress for the patient and their
  representatives. Patients, or their legally authorized
  representatives, will be provided with written information about the
  study upon their arrival at the hospital. The variables assumed to be
  routinely recorded are listed in Section~\ref{sec-variables}.
\item
  Opt in consent and assent for \textbf{non-routinely recorded data}.
  Informed consent for non-routinely recorded data will be actively
  sought from patient participants or their legally authorized
  representative. For participants who are between 15 and 18 years of
  age we will obtain both the assent of the participant as well as the
  consent of their guardian or legally authorized representative. The
  clinical research coordinators will approach patient participants and
  their representatives after admission. The consent and assent will be
  written for patient participants who are admitted to the hospital and
  verbal for participants who are transferred or discharged before the
  clinical research coordinators have had an opportunity to approach
  them. The verbal consent will be audio recorded.
\item
  Waiver of informed consent for patients who are unconscious or
  otherwise unable to provide consent and do not have a legally
  authorized representative. This group represents the most severly
  injured patients and they have to be included to make the trial
  representative of the entire population of trauma patients. Patients
  participants who regain consciousness will be informed about the study
  and asked for consent for collection of non-routinely recorded data.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{data-protection}{%
\subsection{Data protection}\label{data-protection}}

All data will be handled according to the Indian Council of Medical
Research's guidelines and standard operating procedures of the George
Institute for Global Health India on data security and protection. Trial
data will be shared via the trial electronic CRF (eCRF) throughout the
trial. The eCRF will be accessible via VPN with a two-factor
authentication and the data will be held on a secure server. All
investigators and trial site staff involved in this trial must comply
with the requirements of the ICMR Guidelines on data security and
protection. The participant information sheet provided to participants,
will inform them how:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the trial data will be collected, used and disclosed;
\item
  how trial data are stored to maintain confidentiality in accordance
  with national data legislation; and
\item
  for verification of the data, representatives delegated by the
  sponsor, as well as relevant authorities, may require access to parts
  of medical records or trial records that are relevant to the trial,
  including the patient participant's medical history.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{insurances}{%
\section{Insurances}\label{insurances}}

The George Institute for Global Health, India is responsible for

George Institute for Global Health, India is also responsible for
ensuring that India Sites have been obtained and/or will obtain
insurance prior to the opening of the study in India and shall be
maintained for the duration of the study and for an appropriate period
thereafter. This includes being responsible for ensuring that there is
appropriate insurance for the duration of the study to cover against
claims for compensation by participants arising out of their
participation in the trial in India. Compensation in case of injury or
death will be provided by the George Institute for Global Health, India
according to the regulations outlined in rules 39, 40 and 42 of the New

\hypertarget{collection-handling-and-archiving-of-data}{%
\section{Collection, handling, and archiving of
data}\label{collection-handling-and-archiving-of-data}}

Clinical research coordinators will collect data using a paper based CRF
(see Appendix Section~\ref{sec-appendix-case-record-form}), which is
then transferred to an eCRF. All trial data in the CRF must be extracted
from and be consistent with the relevant source documents. The eCRF will
be accessible to trial coordinators, data managers, the Investigators,
Clinical Trial Monitors, Auditors, and Inspectors as required. All data
will be registered, managed, and stored in a manner that enables correct
reporting, interpretation, and verification. The complete Trial Master
File, as well as source documents, will be archived for at least 10
years after the trial is completed. Source data in the medical records
system are stored and archived in accordance with national regulations.
Metadata will be publicly accessible via a persistent DOI, and
anonymised data will be released upon project completion. A detailed
data management plan is available here
\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7748764}.

\hypertarget{source-data}{%
\subsection{Source data}\label{source-data}}

The source data for each variable is given in
Section~\ref{sec-variables}. Whenever medical records are the source
data, this includes imaging and lab reports. Whenever an interview is
given as the source, the CRF will constitute the source data, as this is
where the responses to questions will be recorded. The local
investigator must keep source documents for each patient participant in
the trial. A document describing what has been classified as source data
in the trial (source data reference document) will be included in the
Investigator Site File (ISF). The investigator must ensure that all
source documents are accessible for monitoring and other quality control
activities. Source data is further defined before trial start at each
individual site and can, in cases where source data is not registered in
another document, consist of the CRF. This should be decided in
consultation with the monitor and clearly stated in the source data
reference document. Access to trial-related documentation, such as
patient participants' medical records, CRFs, other source data and other
trial documentation will be provided for monitoring and auditing
purposes. Access will also be granted in the context of regulatory
inspections.

\caption{\label{fig-organisation-overview}Trial organisation overview.}

\end{figure}

Trial management and oversight is governed by three trial committees and
groups: the Trial Team (TT), the Trial Management Group (TMG), the joint
Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committee (SDMC). These groups and
their relationships are briefly described in
Figure~\ref{fig-organisation-overview}. Details about each committee and
group are available in their respective charter.

\hypertarget{trial-team}{%
\subsection{Trial team}\label{trial-team}}

\textbf{Responsibility}

To run the trial on a day-to-day basis, maintain trial databases,
randomise clusters, ensuring complete and correct data, preparing
reports for meetings (including those of the TMG and SDMC) and dealing
with research governance and, if appropriate, regulatory matters.

\textbf{Composition}

Includes the project manager, clinical research associates, principal
investigator and co-investigators as needed.

\textbf{Relationships}

Reports to the TMG and SDMC. Operationalises decisions made by the TMG.

\textbf{Meeting frequencies}

As often as needed, often weekly or bi-weekly.

\hypertarget{trial-management-group-tmg}{%
\subsection{Trial Management Group
(TMG)}\label{trial-management-group-tmg}}

\textbf{Responsibility}

To manage the trial, including its clinical and practical aspects.

\textbf{Composition}

Includes members with broad expertise appropriate to the trial. The TMG
will be chaired by the Principal Investigator.

\textbf{Relationships}

Receives reports from TT. Provides input to the SDMC. Implements
decisions made by the SDMC.

\textbf{Meeting frequencies}

Monthly to every six months.

\hypertarget{joint-trial-steering-and-data-monitoring-committee-sdmc}{%
\subsection{Joint Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committee
(SDMC)}\label{joint-trial-steering-and-data-monitoring-committee-sdmc}}

\textbf{Responsibility}

The SDMC's responsibility is to oversee the trial, review results of
interim analyses and safety events reported by the TMG, and review trial
data for each batch, assessing data quality, completeness, cluster
performance in recruitment and loss to follow-up rates, and external
factors affecting trial validity, safety, or ethics. This committee also
offer guidance to the TMG.

\textbf{Composition}

A majority of independent members, including a chair and three
additional external experts specializing in the clinical area,
biostatistics, and a community or patient representative, as well as and
a minority of members with a direct interest in the trial, including the
principal investigator. The chair should be independent of the trial,
and the coordinating institutions Karolinska Institutet and The George
Institute for Global Health.

\textbf{Relationships}

Receives reports from the trial team and TMG.

\textbf{Meeting frequencies}

After the completion of each batch, but may be more frequent if needed.

\section{Special considerations}\label{special-considerations}}

\hypertarget{funding-1}{%
\subsection{Funding}\label{funding-1}}

This trial is not yet fully funded. The Trial Management Group has
decided to proceed with the trial with the expectation that additional
funding will be secured. The Trial Steering Committee will be informed
of the funding status at each meeting. If funding is not secured, the
trial will be stopped. This will likely result in an underpowered trial.
The justification for this decision is that the intervention is
considered standard of care in many countries and the data collection is
considered minimal risk. There is therefore a very small risk of harm to
patient participants, but a potential direct benefit to those patient
participants who receive the intervention. The benefit-risk ratio is
therefore considered to be favourable, even in the case of an
underpowered trial.

\hypertarget{potential-amendments}{%
\subsection{Potential amendments}\label{potential-amendments}}

There are ongoing discussions about re-framing the trial as a hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial and include a cost-effectiveness
analysis. This would involve adding additional data collection to assess
the implementation and costs of the intervention. This would involve
additional funding and amended ethical approvals.

\hypertarget{notification-of-trial-completion-reporting-and-publication}{%
\section{Notification of trial completion, reporting, and
publication}\label{notification-of-trial-completion-reporting-and-publication}}

The trial will be reported to the Funders within a year of completion.
The results of the trial will also be prepared as manuscripts for
publication. Authorship on trial manuscripts will be based on the
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)
criteria\textsuperscript{43}:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or
  the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
\item
  Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important
  intellectual content; AND
\item
  Final approval of the version to be published; AND
\item
  Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring
  that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the
  work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
\end{itemize}

In addition to being accountable for the parts of the work done, an
author should be able to identify which co-authors are responsible for
specific other parts of the work. In addition, authors should have
confidence in the integrity of the contributions of their co-authors.
\end{quote}

The most recent version of the ICMJE criteria will be adhered to. We
will also use the ICMJE criteria for non-author contributorship.

Before work on a trial manuscript is initiated, a writing group will be
formed and first and last authors will be designated. This writing group
will be formed by discussion in the Trial Management Group.
