# Roles and Responsibilities

# Early in the trial

All prospective independent members of the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) should review the trial protocol prior to the start of participant enrollment. At that time, the trial will also have been evaluated by the Sponsor and Coordinator, examined by other trial committees, and assessed by a research ethics committee. Should a prospective independent TSC member have significant concerns about any aspect of the trial, such as the protocol, operational details, or ethical issues, they must communicate these concerns to the Trial Management Group. While TSC members are expected to offer critical oversight of the trial as it progresses, they should also be supportive of the trial's objectives and methodologies.
