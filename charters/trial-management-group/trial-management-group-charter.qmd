# Relationships

The responsibilities of each trial committee are summarised in @sec-trial-organisation and in @fig-organisation-overview.

# Organisation of meetings

The TMG will meet monthly to every six months, depending on the intensity of the trial. It is expected that more meetings are required early and late in the trial. The meetings will be primarily virtual and will be organised by the trial team. On all issues, every effort should be made to achieve consensus. The role of the Chair is to summarise discussions and encourage consensus; it is therefore best for the Chair to give their own opinion last. The TMG is quorate if the Chair and at least four other members are present.

Members will be expected to send apologies in advance of any meeting they cannot attend.  If a member neither attends nor sends apologies for a meeting, every effort will be made to ensure their availability for the next meeting.  If a member does not attend nor send apologies for the following meeting, they will be asked if they wish to remain part of the TMG. If a member does not attend a third meeting in a row, they will be removed from the TMG, unless there are particular extenuating circumstances.

# Reporting

The TMG will be provided with reports of inclusion rates baseline characteristics, opt-in consent rates and differential opt-in consent rates across trial arms, follow-up rates, CRF return and completeness rates, and safety data. The TMG will also be provided with reports of any other relevant information, such as external evidence that may impact on the trial.

A standard report template will be used to provide information to the TSC. Additional information may be sent from the TMG to the TSC by writing via the TSC Facilitator. A short summary of each meeting with any action points clearly marked will be made. The TMG Chair will sign off these notes. The notes will be kept by the Sponsor and Coordinator.

The TSC is the oversight body for the trial. If the TMG has serious problems or concerns with a TSC decision a meeting of these groups will be held. The information to be shown would depend upon the action proposed and the TSC’s or TMG’s concerns. 

Depending on the reason for the disagreement particularly sensitive trial data may have to be revealed to all or some of those attending such a meeting. The meeting would be Chaired by the DMC Chair or an external expert who is not directly involved with the trial.

# Decision-making

The TMG is responsible for the day-to-day running of the trial and can make decisions appropriate to this role.  However, the TSC is the oversight body for the trial.

## TMG to TSC

The TMG should refer to the TSC in some instances.  The following are examples:

- Request for additional interim analyses owing to concerns raised by external evidence;
- Stopping inclusion due to slow inclusion; 
- Modifying target inclusion, or pre-analysis follow-up, based on any change to the assumptions underlying the original trial sample size calculation (but not on any emerging differences);
- Proposing substantial changes to the protocol, patient information sheet, eligibility criteria and other trial documentation; and
- Request for endorsement for the early presentation of results.

## TMG to DMC

The TMG can make recommendations to the DMC. Possible recommendations from the TMG to the IDMC could include:

- Proposal of extra analyses for review by IDMC; and
- Addition of new trial sites.

## TMG alone

Without referral to other committees, the TMG can:

- Propose strategies for dealing with poor inclusion rates, data quality or compliance with CRFs and/or follow-up schedules according to consistency checks or site monitoring reports.

# After the trial

At the end of the trial there will be meetings of the TMG to discuss the final data. The core of the Writing Committee will be drawn from the TMG. TMG members will promptly return comments on any circulated drafts. The DMC and TSC members may be invited to give advice about data presentation and interpretation. Regardless of the authorship policy of the trial, TMG members will be named and their affiliations listed in the main report, unless they explicitly request otherwise.

# Amendments

Amendments to the TMG Charter will be made by the TMG and approved by the TSC. Amendments to the TMG Charter will be reported to the TSC and DMC.
